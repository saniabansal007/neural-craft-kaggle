My property taxes are less here in California due to me being a XXXXXXXX XXXX.

6265703,"On XX/XX/XXXX  I received an email from my credit monitoring service. It informed me that my credit score had dropped a tremendous amount of points. I logged on and found that AVANTE had illegally posted an alleged collection account to my credit profile. Prior to the email, I have never heard of nor had an account with this company. My report shows that it is an open account and was opened on XX/XX/ with a balance of {$400.00}, {$980.00}, AND {$660.00}. I had no knowledge of this company nor this alleged debt. I have never had any dealings with this company. By federal law, a debt collector is supposed to make contact with an alleged debtor and give them 30 days to validate or dispute. I never receive a letter in the mail that gave me 30 days to validate or dispute this account. I never received a letter stating that I have an alleged debt with this company and owe a balance on that account. Again, I have absolutely no knowledge of this account with them. I, a consumer defined under 15 USC 1692a ( 3 ), understand that, under the FDCPA guidelines for collection agencies, they have to provide ( 1 ) proof that they are the original holder of this debt and can legally hold me responsible for paying this debt and ( 2 ) contractual proof of obligation or an assignment SIGNED from an officer from the original creditors corporation that I am supposed to pay them. 15 USC 1692g Sec. 809 ( b ) of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) grants me the right as a consumer to request validation of this alleged debt they say I owe. I did not receive notice of right to dispute nor did I receive enough information to verify that the alleged debt belonged to me. If I would have gotten anything in the mail or phone call from this company before they illegally reported to my credit report, I would have respectfully requested evidence that I am the person they are asking to pay this debt and a contractual obligation that legally binds me to pay them this debt. Upon them receiving my validation letter, they would have to legally cease from collection calls, letters, and efforts and delete the account from my credit files until they can validate this debt. But again, I never received such a letter about this account or phone call ever in the mail. They have illegally posted and reported to my credit file without adhering to the FDCPA laws. Im not sure if this company is a scam, but I know that this company has broken FCRA and FDCPA laws by reporting an alleged account to my credit report without informing me through mail or phone and I did not receive notice of right to dispute nor did I receive enough information to verify that the alleged debt belonged to me. My credit score has dropped tremendously in the middle of making a major purchase. Please help me get his account removed immediately. As a consumer, Im publicly publishing this descriptive complaint on consumerfinance.gov so that others can learn from my experience and so that this government agency can use this information to help work with other violations and complaints from consumers regarding this company. As a consumer defined under 15 USC 1692a ( 3 ), I'm also preparing to sue under the FCRA and FDCPA because of the numerous consumer law violations committed by this company, damages to my credit and opportunity costs with making a major purchase, and business ventures that must be delayed until this illegal account is removed.

Bank of America told us that we qualify for modification and we meet all the requirements, but there is an issue from 4 years ago that has caused a red flag on my file!!! 

They claim that we failed to give them correct tax returns during the previous modification request which was 4 years ago. The fact of the matter is that 4 years ago we applied for modification which was denied. That process was done through a "" third party '' that represented us during the modification request 4 years ago. Everything that was requested at that time we provided -- including tax returns -- to that representative who should have forwarded them to Bank of America. If that third party failed to forward the requested items to Bank of America, it was not our fault. 
Furthermore, 3 months ago I sent the tax returns for those missing years to Bank of America. 

Now Bank of America claims that 4 years ago they did not receive the tax returns in a timely manner and this is a sign of a legal tax violation!!! Their excuses are just absolute none sense! I have provided all tax documents for 2014 and I even provided the tax returns that they claim were missing from 4 years ago, even though it has no relevance to my current modification request. Bank of America 's response is very unreasonable and unfair. They claim that I qualify for all requirements of the modification plan but because of some vague and unclear excuses, from a previous 4-year old closed file, they can not finalize my current modification file!!! 
They also refuse to explain the problem clearly and in writing!! 

It is very absurd, unfair, and unreasonable for a lender to deny "" permanent '' modification after they approved the trial modification, Based on the status of a 4 year old previous file which was closed a long time ago!!! 
This is very unreasonable and unfair."

16752676,"Mortgage Company : Kentucky Housing Corporation ( XXXX ) On XX/XX/year> I was notified by XXXX that the flood policy on my home had been terminated due to non payment. My premium is paid through my escrow, and my mortgage is on autopay and has never been delinquent. I reached out to XXXX and learned that they received a payment check for the premium 37 days late. This is 7 days past the "" grace '' period, and my XXXX XXXX had been terminated. I then reached out to ( KHC ) and after several phone calls I was eventually told that they would "" credit '' my escrow for {$200.00} for the year 2025, to help me pay for a new premium as this was their error. I was told this before I had gotten a new quote, and when I asked them how they were planning to credit me for the accurate premium once I had received it, and for the remaining 25 years on my mortgage loan, I received no response. The XXXX XXXX  that my previous flood policy was with no longer writes flood policies, so I had to find a new insurance group, and the new flood premium would not include my first time home buyers discounts ect, that I had previously. Since then I have spent an unbelievable amount of hours working through this issue. 

From XX/XX/year> to XX/XX/year> I made XXXX phone calls, and sent XXXX emails to KHC. Each phone call I was transferred to several departments and told to leave a voicemail for a different person each time, which I did, and I never received a return phone call. I have asked to speak to managers, directors, HR, anyone possible to get some answers and I was always disregarded and never received a response. My emails were sent to XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX as those were emails given to me by customer service reps. I was again met with no response. On XX/XX/year>, I physically went to KHC 's main office in XXXX KY, where I was told by XXXX XXXX and her supervisor that once I had a new policy in place they would reimburse me for the difference for this year. XXXX issue with this is that XXXX cashed the check the KHC sent them from my escrow, even though my policy was terminated. So I could not open a new policy because KHC no longer had the funds in my escrow. The other issue with this is that they only offered to cover the difference in this years premium, not for the remaining 25 years of my loan. When I asked what assistance I would receive for the remaining 25 years, I was told it was under review. On XX/XX/year> ( the day I physically went to the office ) I was finally given some assistance on getting the check returned to me so that KHC could put it back in my escrow, it would be mailed to my address. Also, on XX/XX/year> I was told by XXXX XXXX via phone call that she would get information to another XXXX XXXX  that KHC works with, and could write a flood policy for my home. I have left XXXX voicemails for XXXX and XXXX emails since then, requesting the information, and again I have received no response. In the meantime I was unable to move forward with a new flood policy as I was waiting for the refund check to arrive from XXXX. 
On XX/XX/year> I received the refund check from XXXX, and mailed it to KHC. From XX/XX/year> - XX/XX/year> I received no further communication from KHC, or from XXXX XXXX since XX/XX/year>. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received a notice from KHC that a forced insurance coverage was placed on my home with a higher premium, {$2300.00} annually. It is stated the forced policy began on XX/XX/year>. I have included the notice in the files below. 
I called KHC and again, was unable to reach anyone that could help me. I emailed XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, and was told by XXXX that she was "" not sure '' why I received the notice. She then asked me to send her a copy of the Insurance policy that I set up with XXXX through XXXX, I let her know, again, that I have never received any response from XXXX and I was told I could not set up a policy because we were waiting on the refund check. XXXX then stated that they had received the refund check prior to this date and I was never notified. 

It is now XX/XX/year> and I still have not gotten this resolved. I have sent XXXX emails to XXXX and XXXX since XX/XX/year> with no response from either party. At this time my home is covered under a forced flood insurance policy, that should not have been placed, with a much higher premium, due to KHC 's negligence and unprofessionalism towards their clients. I am still unable to get a new flood policy on my own, as I can not set it up through my escrow, simply because KHC will not respond to me."

1988809,"I currently have my first mortgage with Fay Serving. I fell behind on my mortgage payment originally when I went out on medical leave for XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was out of work for 8 weeks and only received 60 % of my pay while on short-term XXXX. During that time period, I was unable to make all of my monthly payments and fell behind. I have been trying to catch up ever since. I tried to make partial payments during this time period and they sent the check back to me. They stated they would not accept anything less than the full amount due. I finally went to my credit union on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for help and my credit union helped me by consolidating my delinquent car loan and personal loan. I was able to save over {$300.00} per month. I was delinquent {$4500.00} on my mortgage at this point. I admit, after the XXXX, I felt overwhelmed and defeated. I did n't know how I would ever catch up. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, my credit union called Fay Servicing on my behalf and we filled out the paperwork for the "" Borrower Assistance Form ''. I completed over XXXX pages of forms and faxed them around XXXX pages of supporting documents ( tax returns, paystubs, checking account statements ) to get help in modifying my mortgage. It took them 2 months to FINALLY get back to me with their decision. I faxed everything on XXXX and they sent me a letter on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. After they reviewed the file, they denied my request for a loan modification. In the notice they sent me, they never sited the reason for the denial. They just stated "" Thank you for contacting us about your mortgage. Based on a careful review of the information you provided to us, unfortunately you are not eligible for an alternative to foreclosure ''. I called on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX and she sited the reason for denial was because "" I did n't make enough money and my house was worth less than the amount I owed ''. Before they sent this notice of denial, they sent an appraiser ( drive-by ) and they valued my home at {$110000.00} ( suggested list price ) and {$100000.00} ( sales price ). I originally purchased my home XXXX XXXX for {$95000.00} and financed my home for 40 years. My current interest rate is 6.250 %. I currently owe {$89000.00} as of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 

They told me they were beginning proceedings to foreclose my home. I was panicked and contacted my mother for financial help. I did n't know what else to do. I was in fear of losing my home. My mortgage payments are {$640.00}. If it was n't for my being out of work, I would be able to meet my mortgage obligation. After I brought the loan current on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, they STILL tried to charge me XXXX late payments. I had to call them and argue with them to remove those XXXX late charges. After paying {$4500.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, the principle on my loan went from {$89000.00} to {$89000.00}. So, basically, after paying close to {$5000.00} on my mortgage my principle balance was only reduced by {$540.00}. 

I 'm writing this official complaint because I feel that this company is very deceptive in their business practices. I do n't understand how after submitting all of my documentation, they could n't help modify my loan in any way. First, I feel that a 40 year mortgage is deceptive on it 's own and paying a high rate of interest 6.250 % is an unfair lending practice. I would like this company to reduce my interest rate and the term of my loan so I am not in debt for the rest of my life. I also would like to know exactly what I paid in late fees. When I look at my account online, I am unable to see this information. I am asking for your help to understand why only {$540.00} went to principle and if this company will modify my loan to provide some ( ANY ) financial relief. I am very upset about how they could not offer any assistance during the past two years. Thank you for your consideration. XXXX XXXX"

As of XX/XX/XXXX, I have filed an identity theft report with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) in accordance with 12 CFR 1022.3 Definitions, which defines identity theft as a fraud committed or attempted using the identifying information of another person without authority. LVNV Funding LLC has violated both the Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S. Code 552a ) and the regulations outlined in 12 CFR 1016.1, with particular focus on the provisions related to consumer privacy rights, opt-out notices, and the prevention of identity theft. 

Under the Privacy Act of 1974, the term "" record '' is comprehensively defined to include any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual maintained by an agency, explicitly encompassing consumer reports. I believe that LVNV Funding LLC may have engaged in activities that violate the provisions set forth in the Privacy Act by mishandling and possibly disclosing sensitive consumer information without proper consent.

Furthermore, under 12 CFR 1016.1, financial institutions, including LVNV Funding LLC, are mandated to provide notice to customers regarding their privacy policies and practices. This includes the conditions under which nonpublic personal information about consumers may be disclosed to nonaffiliated third parties. Consumers are granted the right to opt out of such disclosures, subject to certain exceptions. 

LVNV Funding LLC has violated the following regulations : Failure to Provide Clear and Conspicuous Opt-Out Notice ( 12 CFR 1016.7 ) : Financial institutions must provide a clear and conspicuous notice to consumers explaining the right to opt out, including a reasonable means to exercise this right. Any failure to do so constitutes a violation. 
Unreasonable Opt-Out Means ( 12 CFR 1016.7 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( iii ) ) : LVNV Funding LLC must provide reasonable means for consumers to opt out, such as check-off boxes, reply forms, electronic means, or toll-free telephone numbers. Failure to provide reasonable means is considered a violation. 
Timely Compliance with Opt-Out ( XXXX CFR XXXX ( g ) ) : Financial institutions are obligated to comply with a consumer 's opt-out direction as soon as reasonably practicable after receiving it. Any failure to do so is a violation. 
XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX ( XXXX CFR XXXX ( h ) ) : Consumers have the right to opt out at any time, and financial institutions must respect this right. 
Duration of XXXX 's XXXX XXXX ( XXXX CFR XXXX ( i ) ) : A consumer 's direction to opt out is effective until revoked in writing or electronically, as agreed upon by the consumer. 

I want to emphasize that I take these matters seriously, and I am prepared to pursue legal action to seek justice for the violations of my rights.

While doing so, I noticed TD took my entire check of {$1700.00}. The only thing they could offer me was a payment arrangement of {$41.00} every other week for the next 6 months which I completely agree to. The only issue is I want to have the charge off reversed if possible, even only half of it and the other towards my debt. 

Ive recently left an abusive relationship with XXXX kids, just moved into our own house not even XXXX months ago. I am currently struggling to catch up but making it work. I am behind on my car note, my car insurance, a couple bills, and XXXX is this weekend.

XX/XX/year> I went in person to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX Ca XXXX as per the info from the receipt I have ) and bought {$80.00} since there was another offer from XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX that expired XX/XX/year> and I met the terms of the offer ( screenshot of offer details attached ). The details of the offer is that it is done in person before and up to when the offer expires XX/XX/year>. I did not use a third party, delivery service or third party payment account -buy now pay later. 

On XX/XX/year> I emailed using your secure email system and was told that it was being escalated to the right department and that I will be hearing from someone ( I attached the screenshot of the offer details and that it was added to my chase account wallet. Chase replied XX/XX/year> and I was told that it was being escalated to the right department as per your secure email system. 

On XX/XX/year> I spoke to a supervisor/manager and was told that it is being escalated and a case was created XXXX. I explained that it was not the first time this issue was happening and that previously I had the same issue in XXXX and that by XX/XX/year> I was paid for the XXXX transaction. The supervisor/manager tied it to the issue happening before so that it would be resolve right away and it would not happen again. Since then no one from Chase has bothered to notify me whatsoever as to what is happening or the status of the case. 

On XX/XX/year> I emailed once again using your secure system to find out what if anything was being done. On XX/XX/year> I got an email that basically was patronizing me without telling what if anything had been decided or that my issue was being addressed. 

On XX/XX/year> I called several times and eventually I spoke to a supervisor who told me that the case XXXX had been closed on XX/XX/year> because I did not met the terms of the offer. I asked XXXX to explain me exactly what term I did not met since I had in front of me the terms of the offer ( I have attached that in this email -and it was also attached in your Chase secure email dated XX/XX/year> ). XXXX the Chase manager/supervisor could not explain it. However, he stated that the case was closed. I stated to XXXX that I will be filing a complain with the Consumer Financial Bureau since I had enough. I should not be having to waste so much of my time for the incompetence of Chase and when they can not explain why would Chase refuse to honor the offer. XXXX told me that he was filing a formal complain, but that I had to call back again to get details of it and could not provide me with a reference or case number of the formal complain. 

Previously I taken advantage of offers with XXXXXXXX XXXX that has been offer several times this year and had no issues. I also took advantage of the XXXX offer and within days the offer was honored ( meaning I get the cash bonus ). 

The problem with XXXX XXXX is that Chase posts the transaction as XXXX XXXX. In order to see XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX you have to press account details and then you see the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. As a result the offer for some reason can not be redeemed. I made Chase aware of the same issue in XXXX and by XX/XX/year> I received the {$5.00} bonus earned in XXXX. You would think that XXXX would have fix it so that Customers do not have to experience the same thing over and over again. I should not have to call or complain time and time again. Obviously that is an issue that one has to worry when it comes to trusting a financial institution.

The offer was added to my Chase Wallet. The offer now sits on my expired offers on the Chase Wallet. This would have facilitated the redemption at Chase, but as I stated the transaction is listed as XXXX XXXX rather than XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX."

XXXX XXXX said to me, go ahead, you can do that. I have never dealt with such rude management, especially at a bank. I asked Officer XXXX why this instead of filing a police report.

2387940,"My mortgage holder, has attempted to, and is presently trying to, fraudulently foreclose on my home, doing so for years now, using various extreme predatory lender tactics. They are Freedom Mortgage, my loan number is XXXX, their phone number is : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The property address is XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA XXXX. 
I was referred to you by my US Congressman XXXX XXXX that sent an inquiry on my behalf to you yesterday. 
Freedom Mortgage is colluding with our homeowner 's insurance provider, XXXX XXXX, to literally steal our home. This has gone on for at least two years and is out of control. A couple of months ago, our lender, and our insurer, nearly succeeded on foreclosing on our VA Home loan without us even knowing about it. 
Our home has been gutted down to the bare wood underlayment subflooring with several walls, ceilings, and fixtures demolished. The home is obviously unlivable, and it is dangerously contaminated. There was a break-in while we were gone, blood and XXXX sprayed everywhere through our home, the intruder died there, the police investigated and emailed us that he had been dead there for several days. 
We requested to our lender XXXX Freedom Mortgage XXXX that they allow us to not pay our mortgage till the home could be repaired or replaced. They refused to cooperate, months later they finally sent us forms so we could fill them out to stop having to make payments, we submitted them, they vaguely claimed to have lost the application and or lied and said they never received them. 
The lender has several times transferred our mortgage to other entities, other companies, then gotten back to them, to cause confusion and failure of automatic payments to go through. It has been a huge battle for several years just to get them to cooperate so we can have automatic payments so we do not fail to make a payment. Because they have moved our mortgage around so much, when we make a payment, either automatically or over the phone, it does not go through. We call them and they say they received the payment, but later they claim they did not. They often charge late fees as part of this elaborate scam, that we have to fight them about too. They are always hostile and provoking on the phone. 
Just like our lender, our insurer cancelled our policy in secret a few months ago, did bizarre things in conjunction with our lender to block our payments, instead of the lender working properly to make sure we had insurance. They both create paper trails that make it look like they are cooperating but they are not. Our insurer sent a Claims Adjuster to our home that we met there for his inspection. He had 4 other people with him, from a crime scene clean up company XXXX called XXXX XXXX as there was a police report on file of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
Our home can not be remediated of XXXX XXXX. 
The Adjuster was hostile and dangerous acting and would not leave and let us lock up the property. We had to call 911, two sheriff 's cruisers arrived almost immediately, they all tried to con the cops into arresting me but one of the cops that knew me saw through his plan. He had already lied on the 911 tape to dispatch over my cellular speaker phone about his description and color of his car. He had a XXXX but kept it in his waste band under his shirt most of the time. Our home was taken over by force like that because our insurer, in cahoots with our lender, do anything and everything to criminally take our home from us. We have a low fixed interest rate, about {$70000.00} equity in our home. The lender has tried to get me arrested, conspiring to wrongfully take our home, knowingly exploiting my extreme 100 % service-connected XXXX from honorable war service in the XXXX XXXX XXXX.

I have paid the same monthly amount for almost XXXX years. I have never been late, as the loan is an automated ACH payment from my bank account. I do not have an escrow account as I pay insurance and taxes outside of At some point in summer of XXXX, Freedom Mortgage contacted me regarding insurance coverage via mail. As I already have insurance coverage, I disregarded the notice. What apparently happened was I misunderstood they needed proof of my coverage. They did not contact my insurance agent. They did not call or email me for additional information. 

Instead, they applied an insurance coverage over twice as expensive, but no more thorough, than that which I already had, and determined it needed to come from escrow, so they considered me in negative escrow, driving up my monthly payment. I was not aware of this. 

My insurance company, meanwhile, was providing updates to XXXX XXXX, the original provider of the mortgage. 

By the time I understood this, I think in XXXX, I started following up. I was not getting my mail regularly during the fall due to staying in a remote area due to Covid, and my mail not getting forwarded. 

By XXXX when I got reconnected to my mail ( again, no call, no email in the interim ), Freedom mortgage had - reported me negatively on my credit report, causing my score to drop not only below XXXX for the first time i believe in over a decade, but BELOW XXXX, which means i am unable to get good rates on anything - continued to collect my monthly payments but NOT APPLY THEM TO MY MORTGAGE - instead holding them in an unapplied payments 'bucket ' - put me in collections, considering me over {$4000.00} in arears as of XX/XX/XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, I provided, via email, to Freedom Mortgage, proof of ongoing insurance coverage and no gap for the last two years. In addition, I asked to have my credit restored, my payment returned to its monthly amount prior to this, the escrow eliminated since I do not owe it, and the payments they have been holding, PLUS THE INTEREST earned on them applied to my balance. I have not heard back from them. 

I am now unable to refinance at a lower rate or from a more reputable company due to the issues they have created with my credit report. I am astounded."

This information does not relate to any transactions I made. I did not authorize anyone to use my personal information. I hereby exercise my legal rights enacted by Congress and The Federal Trade Commission, which explicitly states when a victim files an affidavit it shall be honored by all credit bureaus and all fraudulent information must be blocked within 4 days and proper notification shall be given to all furnishers pursuant to section 605b of The Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act. Failure to comply shall lead to complaints being filed with The XXXX XXXX XXXX, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Attorney General with legal action of your companys unlawful collection practices, misrepresentation of reporting inaccurate debts, and noncompliance to adhere to laws enacted to help who are victims of identity-theft. I request that an extend fraud alert be placed in my file explaining that fraudulent applications may be submitted in my name. Do not extend credit without first contacting me personally and verifying all applications. 

The below-listed accounts by the Original Creditors, who have reported these accounts within my credit reports, were not opened by me. I also did not give my authorization for anyone else to open these accounts. Someone else of who did these that I did not know. 


Policy states. 

According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act FCRA 611 ( 15 U.S.C 1681 ), Procedure In Case of Disputed Accuracy.

( a ) Reinvestigation ( 1 ) Reinvestigation ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection ( f ), if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumers file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller. 

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit-reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts. 

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type of fraudulent activities. 

It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below-listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve the accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries. 



It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore, inaccurate in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out go my credit files. 

1. Identity Theft XXXX  XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Please remove it from my credit report. 



I am well aware of my rights as a consumer. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit-reporting agency report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file. My credit issues are very specific, these accounts and/or items do not belong to me. This means that you are reporting incorrect account information within my credit report. It is this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be Blocked and Deleted. 

According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act FCRA, Section 1681c ( 2 ) Block of information resulting from identity-theft.

1.Block. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity-theft, not later than four ( 4 ) business days after the date receipt by such agency of 1. Appropriate proof of identity of the consumer ; 2. A copy of an identity theft report 3. The identification of such information by the consumer ; and 4. A statement by the consumer that the information relating to the transaction by the consumer. 

I have provided all of the above listed four ( 4 ) items within this package. Therefore, I expect these listed accounts to be deleted and blocked within ( 4 ) business days. This is clearly an identity theft issue. I am also entitled to receive a free copy of my credit report, so I am requesting a free credit report and that all of these accounts, public records items, and inquiries be permanently blocked and deleted.

13080686,"Product : Checking or Savings Account Issue : Managing an account / Problem making or receiving payments Account Type : Checking Account Company : Sofi Bank Date Issue Began : XX/XX/year> Complaint Description : This is my third formal complaint to the CFPB regarding Sofi Bank 's continued failure to provide competent customer service, accurate resolution of payment issues, and basic banking operations. Prior complaint references are : Complaint # XXXX submitted on XX/XX/year> Complaint # XXXX submitted on XX/XX/year> Both complaints remain unresolved despite repeated assurances from Sofi. The situation has worsened, and now a new, related incident involving my son has emerged, exposing even more operational failures. 

Original Complaint Summary : On XX/XX/year>, I used Sofi 's Bill Pay service to send XXXX {$600.00} checks to XXXX for XXXX dues. When I requested check images, XXXX first sent the wrong ones. I followed up multiple times, but each interaction with customer service was chaotic. Support agentsmainly based in the XXXX untrained, unable to follow instructions, and repeatedly asked for the same information. The lack of access to previous chat records meant restarting the process every time. 

Eventually, Sofi claimed they reissued new checks and sent them via express mail. However, my HOA received checks with stop payments placed on themwithout my authorization. Sofi never offered a logical explanation for this and failed to verify whether the original checks were ever delivered or not. The entire Bill Pay process broke down due to internal miscommunication, disorganized support channels, and no accountability. 

Sofis brand image as a technology-driven company is a complete mismatch with its broken infrastructure and outsourced support. Promises were made but never fulfilled, and the issue has been dragging on for over XXXX months. Sofis response has been generic, dismissive, and ineffective. 

New Complaint Wire Transfer Issue for My Son A new issue has now emerged involving my son, XXXX XXXX, whose Sofi account ends in XXXX. He intended to make an ACH transfer, but due to misleading XXXX and poor customer service guidance, the transfer was processed as a wire transfer, incurring an unnecessary {$30.00} wire fee. 

We opened a support ticket ( # XXXX ) and followed up for XXXX days. Eventually, Sofi admitted their fault, but instead of fixing the issue or refunding the fee, they kept sending us in circles. On XX/XX/year>, we had yet another failed support chatagain with a XXXX representative who failed to understand the issue even after the full email thread was provided. 

To make matters worse, Sofi customer service adopted a game of deflectiontelling my son to ask his father ( me ) to reach out, and then telling me to ask my son to contact them instead. This ping-pong of accountability is absurd and offensive. Just do the work and stop wasting customer time. 

Ongoing Pattern of Failure Sofi seems fundamentally unprepared to operate as a bank. Their obsession with cutting costs through offshore outsourcing has resulted in : Untrained, disorganized, and poorly supervised customer service No consistent chat or issue tracking Confusing escalation paths with no ownership Prolonged resolution timelines A culture of passing responsibility instead of solving problems Sofis left hand doesnt know what the right hand is doing. Whether its check payments, wire refunds, or chat handling, nothing is working as it should. As a technology company, they should enable customer self-service. Instead, they push customers through frustrating, unnecessary loops with agents who create more problems."

I had rented the house right before all of this and the BANK OF AMERICA sent a rep to my house and disclosed all of my personal information to my tenant and told him that I had not paid the bank for 5 years without explaining why and My tenant became enraged and said I was lying and DESTROYED my home. he also stopped paying rent for 6 months at {$2000.00} per month which was money I planned to use to pay the bank with hopefully. when I got the house back he had done so much damage as a result of the two visits from the bank, that I could n't sell it. it needed all new carpet, new Windows, new appliances, rock work, new doors and a new garage door. the damage was estimated at {$40000.00} and that was if I did the work myself. 
so going back to when the bank foreclosed. I asked XXXX to send me the deed to the house which they did not have. they did not have our signatures.and the contract they had was fabricated. I have the original documents. they did n't match up at all. they never listed the sale in the paper and they stopped taking my calls.

the house was sold within seconds of being for sale. they took my home with all of the money I had ( OVER {$200000.00} OF EQUITY ) and they sold it and demanded me out. 
not only were they outside of the jurisdiction to even collect on this loan in California ( 4 years max ), they had falsified all of the documents and lied and misled me and were reviewing documents for a modification when they knew they were never going to consider me this is criminal on a giant scale. they are no different then a thief. I am homeless. I have XXXX kids. that equity was all of the money I had and now I have awful credit and a XXXX has left me unable to work in the capacity that I am used to working. 
sometimes I sleep in my car. my kids have to stay with their dad all of the time until I figure out how to deal with this. that kills me. they broke so many laws I ca n't even begin to list them. and it had devastated me and my family. all so that the bank of America could get a measly amount of money to them but a life changing amount for us. and you ask why I did n't fight them? with what money. my savings are gone. I have slept on the beach with my dog. the lawyers all wanted money up front to fight and when I say no one I mean after making hundreds of calls to help me there was not one including any state or federal people that offered. oh I get to tell my story here. it was a cut and dry thing.

11132268,"XXXX XXXX XXXX, MD XXXX Account # XXXX Notice to an agent is notice to the principal. 


Dear XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Department , I am writing to formally address your response to my initial complaint and to clarify the nature of my request. It appears there has been a fundamental misunderstanding of the specific relief sought. To avoid any further confusion, I am providing a clear restatement of my demands and the legal obligations at issue.

Your response falsely characterized my request as a "" Validation of Debt. '' This is incorrect. Nowhere in my correspondence did I make a request for validation of debt. If your review of my attached letter in the CFPB complaint had been thorough, this mischaracterization would have been avoided. I expect all future responses to address the actual substance of my request.

The heart of my request concerns your compliance with the statutory obligation outlined in 15 U.S.C. 1637 ( b ). Specifically, I requested documented proof that periodic statements containing the required disclosures were mailed or delivered to me at least 21 days before each payment due date. I did not ask for "" delivery of statements '' in the generic sense. Rather, I am demanding proof of compliance with the statutory requirement that these statements be sent in accordance with the timeline mandated by law. Your failure to provide this proof is a material violation of your statutory obligations.

Your reliance on my potential opt-in for electronic communications is misplaced. Participation in electronic delivery does not, in any way, waive my right to receive the disclosures required by 15 U.S.C. 1637 ( b ) through USPS or another medium that ensures compliance with the 21-day rule. If you believe otherwise, I request that you provide the specific statutory provision or contractual language that explicitly overrides this right. Absent such a provision, your assumption is legally unsupportable.

I hereby demand that you provide specific, tangible proof of your compliance with 15 U.S.C. 1637 ( b ) for all relevant billing cycles. This proof must demonstrate the date and method of delivery for each periodic statement. Generalized statements, unsupported assertions, or copies of billing statements do not satisfy this request. I expect to see clear documentation of the date, method, and medium by which the required disclosures were sent to me. This includes, but is not limited to, tracking information, mailing logs, or certified records of electronic transmission.

Summary of My Demand : Proof of delivery for statements in compliance with 15 U.S.C. 1637 ( b ).

Documented evidence of the date and method of transmission for each statement.

A direct response that addresses the actual issues raised in this letter, rather than generalized boilerplate responses.

Failure to provide the required proof within a reasonable time will result in further escalation, which may include additional complaints to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), regulatory oversight agencies, and any other relevant consumer protection bodies. Please ensure that your response directly addresses each of the specific demands and factual inaccuracies outlined in this letter. 

I look forward to your timely response. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"

They informed me that even though the check will clear they are still freezing my account, holding all deposits including the check and direct deposits simply because her phone number is not listed under her name. This is a common thing, my phone number is listed under my husbands name.

They do not disclose that they will close your account and freeze all money if you deposit a perfectly good check if the person in question does not have a phone in their name. Again the check has her phone number printed on it and her bank has verified every possible question given to them.

I spoke to 4 different people at chase and two people at the other parties bank in an attempt to resolve this issue this morning.

12402864,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, FLORIDA, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Subject : Formal Complaint Regarding Inaccurate Late Payment Reporting Dear CFPB Representative, I am writing to formally dispute an inaccurate late payment entry on my credit report, as allowed under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681i ). This inaccurate reporting has negatively affected my credit profile, and I am requesting an immediate investigation into this matter.

Details of the Disputed Late Payment : Creditor Name : CAF Account Number : # XXXX Date of Alleged Late Payment : XX/XX/XXXX ( equifax ), XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX and XXXX XXXX I firmly believe this late payment is incorrect. Additionally, I am providing the following supporting evidence : Discrepancies and errors Late Payment Date Discrepancies Across Bureaus : Equifax reports a 30-day late payment in XX/XX/XXXX. 
XXXX & XXXX report a 30-day late payment in XX/XX/XXXX. 
This inconsistency suggests inaccurate reporting, as the same account can not have different late payment dates across bureaus. 
Account Status and Payment Status Contradictions : All three bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, and Equifax ) report the account as Open and Current. 
If the account is in current standing, a 30-day late payment should not be reported. 
Date of Last Activity Mismatch : XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX Equifax : XX/XX/XXXX These variations further indicate reporting inconsistencies. 
Last Payment Date Mismatch : XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX Equifax : XX/XX/XXXX The close proximity of these dates raises questions about how late payments were recorded in early XXXX. 
Legal Basis for Dispute : Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) - 15 U.S. Code 1681i I am exercising my right under this section to dispute inaccurate information reported on my credit file. The reported late payment does not accurately reflect my payment history, and I am requesting a formal investigation and correction. 
Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) - 15 U.S. Code 1637 ( b ) Creditors must provide clear and accurate billing statements to consumers. If this late payment reporting does not align with the terms of my agreement, it constitutes an error that should be rectified immediately.

Obligations of Information Furnishers - 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 Creditors and furnishers must ensure that the information reported to credit bureaus is accurate. If the creditor can not substantiate the late payment with verifiable documentation, they must remove it from my credit file.

Requested Action : Conduct a thorough investigation into this dispute and provide a written response within 30 days as required by law. 
If the late payment can not be verified, instruct the creditor to update my account status to "" Paid As Agreed, Never Late. '' Notify the credit reporting agencies ( XXXX, Equifax and XXXX ) to reflect the corrected information on my credit report. 
Reference to PAANL ( Paid As Agreed Never Late ) : The terms of our agreement have always been adhered to, and the account in question should reflect a status of "" Paid As Agreed Never Late '' based on the timely payments made. It is imperative that my credit report accurately represents my financial responsibility and commitment to meeting payment obligations. 

I hereby request that you provide documented proof supporting the claim of late payments on this account. This proof should include specific details such as dates, amounts, and any relevant communication indicating that the payments were indeed late. In the absence of valid proof, I expect the credit reporting to be rectified promptly. 

If, after a thorough investigation, you are unable to provide verifiable proof of late payments, I demand that the account be promptly updated to reflect its accurate status as "" Paid As Agreed Never Late. '' Per the FCRA, I request that you conduct a timely investigation and provide a written response within 30 days from the receipt of this dispute letter.

Failure to adhere to this timeline will be considered a violation of the FCRA. Appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and expect a resolution that aligns with the legal obligations outlined by the FCRA. Your cooperation is crucial in maintaining the accuracy and fairness of my credit report. 
Failure to properly investigate and correct this inaccurate information will result in further actions, including a potential escalation to legal authorities for non-compliance with federal consumer protection laws.

Since Select Portfolio Servicing did not previously request a refund for their duplicate payment in a timely fashion, after it was made ; it may have gone past the statue of limitations and then have to have the matter reviewed by the Tax Review Board. The first step that Select Portfolio Servicing should have taken was not to penalize me and force me to pay, but contact the Refund Revenue department and fill out the appropriate forms. I will attach the link below and a copy of the form if possible. The contact for the department of Refund for Revenue is XXXX. The contact for the Tax Review Board, if the refund is at first denied because of statue of limitations is XXXX. I was told by the representative at the Refund Revenue department that Select Portfolio Servicing should have requested the refund by XXXX XXXX. I have been documenting my telling Select Portfolio Servicing Inc. to do this very thing on numerous filed complaints to CFPB, conversations, and calls to Select Portfolio Servicing since Select Portfolio Servicing started their initial penalizing me and charging me in XXXX. The representative also stated that Select Portfolio Servicing has to show proof of the payment/check and if Select Portfolio Servicing wanted me to collect the refund, Select Portfolio Servicing would have to send a letter on company letter head to the Refund Revenue department instructing them to do so. This was also suggested by myself and 100 % ignored followed by an initial penalty. I will check back with the Refund Review department to see if the steps are taken by Select Portfolio Servicing to correctly retreive the duplicate payment made on my taxes for XXXX. I also look forward to any and all reinbursement of previous penalty payments made to Select Portfolio Servicing Inc .

We applied, basically, every 90 days for a mortgage modification after I lost my job, due to a work related illness. They would tell us that we did not submit a document or we did not reply within the specified time frame. All of these reasons were untrue. This appears to be XXXX nefarious scheme to steal real estate property, and were subsequently fined for these illegal practices. About the time the Florida Attorney General was closing in on XXXX XXXX XXXX, they sold the mortgage to Selene Finance. We tried to apply for a mortgage modification again but the balance had increased by {$50000.00}. To a new total of {$200000.00}. In the meantime, we have experienced a sinkhole under the home and are currently in litigation with the insurance company. XXXX XXXX XXXX tried to file a motion to stop the foreclosure due to the sinkhole claim, but the circuit judge denied the motion. We filed bankruptcy to stop the sale. When the bankruptcy was discharged due to not being able to pay the filing fee, XXXX XXXX XXXX again initiated a foreclosure. XXXX XXXX XXXX foreclosed on the property illegally. Selene Finance has been the owner of the mortgage since XXXX, XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX stole the property through their robo foreclosure law firm XXXX XXXX, on XXXX XXXX, XXXX.

I did not reach out to CashApp after filing the complaint and the closure of my account came 8 days after filing the report. I believe this is an unfair treatment and my account was wrongfully closed. I will attach a screenshot of the email saying they have closed my account. I also want whoever reading this that the sole reason is because I filed this complaint that my account on CashApp has been closed.

I had added everything I decided purchase, and completed my order using my cash card from Cash App. I had already added their offered boost of {$100.00} off any purchase anywhere onto my cash card, specifically for this purchase, as I usually have big orders when ordering from this company. My grand total was {$150.00} and right away I had a notification pop up letting me know that the boost had saved me {$100.00} off my total purchase, and the initial charge was {$56.00} to my cash card. So the next day I go to transfer $ from my Cash App to my online games, and it said insufficient funds, so I checked my balance and activity, and all of a sudden, the {$100.00} was gone and the total purchase price went to {$130.00} so I contacted Cash App support. And it has been a nightmare since. Every time I send a message, a new agent joins and obviously doesnt read anything from the previous interactions. They keep giving me the run around, telling me that I didnt have the boost on my card, when I know XXXX well that I did. I have screenshots of all of my interactions with their support team agents, and I also have a downloaded PDF document of my transaction history with Cash App. And if you look at my statement, it clearly shows that I had some sort of boost on my cash card when I made the original transaction, because it shows a cash boost refund to my cash card. I literally am about to lose my mind with them. Theyre rude, they dont do their job, and this is now going to be a second time that Im being screwed by them. I just want them to stand by their advertisements about the boost. I want my {$100.00} back, I was saving that for dog food, and other necessary household items."

I have now disputed this closed account twice by certified mail. All in which EXPERIAN failed to properly investigate. I have submitted all documents to show my attempt to validate this debt which XXXX XXXX has failed to respond. EXPERIAN also has failed to send me the results of this DISPUTE which was made on XXXX  XXXX, XXXX. I made several attempts to rectify this matter with XXXX XXXX directly and which a Debt of Validation letter was also sent to them by Certified Mail. When speaking to the representative they stated this account was closed because it was paid off, all of which I have absolutely no recollection of. I asked to please send me any documents indicating my involvement with that alleged payment to close the account and signature confirmations of so. They refused to comply with any of my request and rather this account report negative on my file. From that point is where I completed the Debt Of Validation Process which EXPERIAN has failed to send an results within 30 days as well. Today I reached out to EXPERIAN once again which was an overall disaster speaking to the representatives. None of the representatives would assist me or explain what was the results of the dispute. The representatives hung up the phone 3 times on me. The representatives I spoke with today stated their names were : XXXX XXXX XXXX in the "" XXXX XXXX '' location. EXPERIAN has twice now failed to honor my right as a citizen of the United States of America and has violated the Fair Debt Collections Practice Act, 15 USC 1692g. All documents attached will reflect the legal process I followed to validate this closed account on my file. The issue at hand is that this single account, is the "" ONLY '' account that is being reported as missed payments which does not belong to me. I have several accounts all with absolutely perfect payment history, under 10 % utilization and yet in the midst of a Global Pandemic, I am unable to receive any lending offers due to this "" ONE '' negative report by XXXX XXXX from XXXX. We are now in XXXX and due to XXXX XXXX account reporting a missed payments, and regardless of my perfect payment history, I continue to have issues with receiving house loans, credit card offers, or credit increases. This has now become in inhuman like treatment for an account reported paid off and closed from XXXX. As an XXXX American man, I am saddened that I am a victim of this Systematic Racism preventing me from excelling financially with Economic system based on CREDIT REPORTING. Beyond the algorithms that come into play, we as people do have the opportunity to make a choice. A choice between what is right and what is wrong. I am a husband and a father and have to suffer financially due to this one account. EXPERIAN has also failed to provide any documents pertaining this account or anything indicating my legal obligation, or signature proof what so ever. I believe no investigation took place to thoroughly examine this account that had been closed since XXXX. I asked that the EXPERIAN thoroughly examine all documents provided and to honor the Fair Debt Collections Practice Act, 15 USC 1692g and my request to have this account be removed. I am hoping we can all identify with this inhuman like treatment and that one should not suffer for another 4 years for a closed account never validated. I asked to please review the documents provided with a complete unbiased decision to honor my request, as it is the legal obligation of a Credit Bureau. I am advised by my attorney to inform you that all correspondence have been forward to his office as well, as a failure to respond will result in a legal suit."
3618933,"Dear Legal Department, This credit dispute is being submitted as a new evidence dispute. The accounts that are being disputed, does not belong to me. Below is my sworn statement concerning these credit issues.

It is my sworn statement that I declare under penalty of perjury ( "" under the laws of the United States "" if executed outside of the United States '' ) that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute. I also understand that knowing and a willful misstatement or omissions of material facts constitutes a federal criminal violation punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Additionally, these misstatements are punishable l1S perjury under 18U.S.C. 1621.

The tradelines listed below are items currently within my credit file, and none of these are related to any transaction that was made by me. It is my official statement that someone and/or several people have opened these accounts and made transactions on these accounts without my knowledge or authorization, my personal information has been used to obtain goods, services, or money : and the person ( s ) responsible for creating these accounts.

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so.

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person.

Likewise, these COLLECTION ACCOUNTS are also not mine. None of these belong to me. This means that I was not the person, which had an account with the original creditor, which has sold these accounts to these collection agencies that are now reporting the debts.

Incorrect Balance Reporting : The report states both "" 0 % left to pay '' and "" XXXX  % left to pay, '' while maintaining a {$7200.00} balance, creating inconsistency and misleading reporting.

You were advised by me on my letter dated XX/XX/2023 ( copy enclosed ) to investigate a few things that I believe are inaccurate. That request was written by me and mailed by me-not a third party agency. 
It appears obvious to me that you are abusing your power under the FCRA to escape a complete investigation. And FYI, I did some research on the matter and found that there is no law forbidding a consumer from using a credit repair agency, which makes your response even more absurd! 
As a matter of fact, Congress has found the process so overwhelming that they specifically afford consumers the right to use a third party agency on their behalf if they so choose. Congress also reserves my right to sue a credit bureau for violations of the FCRA.

I believe I can prove that you did not use reasonable measures to insure the accuracy of my credit reports and you are now stalling the process further. I realize disputes may be expensive and therefore it is your job to stall them but you do so at great risk.

My wife felt immensely uncomfortable as the home owner would sit under the windows and "" clear any weeds out of the yard. '' Eventually, enough was enough. The property management company did nothing about the harassment, so we placed our 30 days notice, lost pet and rent deposits and left. 

My wife and I found out of the Certified Collectors of XXXX, Texas had placed the combined debt of the XXXX companies for almost {$15000.00} with NO detailed statement of the charges.

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, my lender, Selene Finance, denied my loan modification request stating that I had "" insufficient income to support a modified payment ''.

5566108,"I am requesting assistance from CFPB to have Marcus XXXX  pay its promised {$100.00} bonus that I signed up for on XX/XX/2022. I have contacted the bank about this matter. The bank insists that I signed up for the promotion after I funded the account. But the fact is I signed up for the promotion as I opened the account and before it was actually funded. I am providing the screen shots to prove this ( the bank did not ask for any proof from me ; they just simply denied the bonus ). 

I believe the denial has to do with a systemic error on the banks part. When I checked my interest on XX/XX/2022, Marcus asked me again to sign up for the promotion. Just to make doubly sure I was enrolled in the promotion, I clicked on the bar to enroll. Now Marcus is insisting that I enrolled in the promotion on XX/XX/XXXX, not when I opened and funded the account on XX/XX/XXXX ( even though the attached screen shots made on XX/XX/XXXX show otherwise ), so I am not entitled to the {$100.00} bonus. I believe that Marcus intentionally sent a confusing promotion to me on XX/XX/XXXX to sign up again so that it could eventually avoid paying the bonus -- -a classic bait-and-switch tactic. 

Here are the facts : I signed up for the {$100.00} promotion on XX/XX/2022 following the prompts as indicated ( see attached ). 

The required {$10000.00} was sent on XX/XX/2022 to my new Marcus account ( actual amount deposited was {$10000.00} ). This balance was maintained in the account more than the required 90 days. 

I had no reason to believe that I was not enrolled in the promotion, because I followed all of the prompts online for the promotional offer on XX/XX/2022. 

I checked my interest on XX/XX/2022. Marcus sent an additional offer to sign up for the {$100.00} bonus. Just to make sure I was enrolled, I clicked on the button to sign up for a second time on XX/XX/XXXX. 

When the promised {$100.00} bonus did not pay out on time, I called Marcus customer service on XX/XX/2022 and spoke to XXXX in Virginia. I was told that I funded the account before I enrolled in the bonus offer. When I stated that I actually enrolled in the offer when I opened and funded the account on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, the representative said it would be investigated, but never asked me for proof of the screen shots I took as I opened the account. I was told I would hear a response in 1-3 business days.

A representative never followed up on my case, so I called again on XX/XX/2022. XXXX told the same thing I was told originally : that I funded the account before I was enrolled. He also did not want proof of screen shots of my original enrollment in the promotion on XX/XX/XXXX and was not interested in helping me resolve this matter. 

I am a senior living on a fixed income. It appears that Marcus deliberately set up a system to take advantage of vulnerable customers like myself so it could concoct a reason to use my money at a low interest rate for three months without having to pay out the {$100.00} promotion. Would CFBP please ensure that Marcus is actually delivering on what they had promised by having them pay out the {$100.00} promotion to me? Thank you."
2362618,"Good afternoon, I 'm desperate to reach you regarding an issue with a mortgage bank who has been extremely predatory ... so much so, that I am on the cusp of losing my home. To make a long story short, my husband passed away after a XXXX year illness that took nearly everything from us. We were foreclosed upon, and thankfully XXXX from the XXXX saved our home. In the process though, our interest rate was elevated to nearly 10 %! 
My husband died XXXX years ago this coming XX/XX/XXXX, and I 've desperately tried to refinance, qualify for other financial programs to no avail. My credit was destroyed by delinquencies related to medical bills, medical treatment, bills going unpaid so we could purchase my husbands medication, travel cost out of state for his treatment, etc. I am unable to refinance because of my credit score. 
In XX/XX/XXXX I started the process with my bank to qualify for HARP ... I 've submitted the required documentation over XXXX times, by fax, certified mail, regular mail, and mostly - electronic upload directly to them. 
EVERY TIME, despite filling out this required paperwork ( XXXX sections ) with representatives of the company, who took pity on my situation after multiple uploads .... who assured me every I was dotted and every T was crossed ... .that there was "" no way they can say you do n't have all the required documentation turned in '' ... THEY DID! 
For 14 months now I have called, faxed, uploaded, mailed, filled out, re-filled out, re-re-filled out, re-re-re-filled out forms, the same ones over and over and over and over again .... and 14 months later I have not had any success in qualifying, being approved, being helped, or reaching any relief for my family and I. I 'm paying nearly {$1900.00} a month for my house not including taxes and insurance! I owe more now than I did when my husband and I refinanced it 14 years ago! We 've owned our property since XX/XX/XXXX ... it 's all my children and I have left ... my husband and I worked so hard for what we have, and because of predatory lending/banks ... .I 'm about to lose it all! 
XX/XX/XXXX the HARP program ended .... I was no closer to being approved on XX/XX/XXXX than I was when I started the process in XX/XX/XXXX. Now into XX/XX/XXXX I 'm nowhere closer to ending this nightmare than I was in XX/XX/XXXX I 've had two relationship managers, the 2nd seems to be a little better than the first, but it still has not helped me. When I call his direct extension he has NEVER answered and he does not ( I 've been told multiple times ) have voicemail. On a request for a callback from him dated XX/XX/XXXX - I finally received a call back, NOT from him, but a representative who knew nothing more than I did ... on XX/XX/XXXX 
I 'm now desperately trying to qualify for the HAMP, but I 'm fearful that if this continues, I will be losing my home to foreclosure before that ever happens. It 's evident the bank DOES NOT want to help me, and I 've run out of options. I 'm raising my family alone, I 've tried everything I know to do to get this done and frankly, I 'm losing. I need help. Please, please tell me you know how to get this mortgage company to do what they 're morally, ethically and federally required to do. I 've about reached the end of my rope ... .. I ca n't take anymore struggle, stress and continued disappointment and worry. This is not the American Dream - it 's a nightmare.

2426169,"In XX/XX/XXXX we were struggling with our mortgage payments on our XXXX mortgage with citibank and we were underwater. They were offering loan modifications so we signed up. We had been in the house for 35 years and wanted to stay. That process of loan modification began a 2 year paperwork nightmare during which they told us to make {$1200.00} a month payments because that 's about what our future payments would be and we did. During the process they readily admitted they did not know exactly what they were doing. Eventually we were notified that our modified payments would be {$2200.00} a month, which is {$100.00} less than we had been paying before we started the modification process. The girl from citi actually said "" Whoops! Guess we got that wrong! '' In addition, they applied back interest so instead of owing XXXX we now had a mortgage of if memory serves {$230000.00}. They agreed to a short sale but would not modify our mortgage to {$170000.00} and let us keep the house. We let it fall into foreclosure and citi sold it for {$80000.00} since it had fallen into disrepair, a couple of years later to a house flipper. At the very end they transferred our mortgage to XXXX who tried to collect money from us.but somehow citi was still the bank that foreclosed. The house flipper spent about {$20000.00} to refurbish and sold it some poor unsuspecting person for {$400000.00}, more than {$50000.00} above appraised value. Citi ruined our lives by stringing us along for two years thinking we could keep our house with a loan modification and then making it impossible. It ruined our lives and we will never recover because at the time we were already into retirement age and now we are in our XXXX. I knew we were scammed but I could n't prove and still ca n't because I do n't know what went on behind the scenes. I suspects their confused and untrained representatives stuffed and maybe destroyed documents they had no idea what to do with. It is now XX/XX/XXXX and I have only now been able to rise above the devastation enough to put into words what little I know about what happened to us.If citi had been honest instead of stringing us along for years, we could have sold the house and walked away with, probably with no profit but at least without suffering forclosure and bankruptcy."

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) has recently filed a lawsuit against Experian, alleging systematic issues such as failing to forward consumer-provided evidence to furnishers, accepting unreliable responses, and failing to adequately notify consumers of dispute outcomes.

My first loan payment, I thought was due to SLS XX/XX/2021. I paid and it went through. I got the letter from XXXX about hazard insurance at the end of XXXX and thought it was spam. In the beginning on XXXX I was trying to pay my mortgage payment with SLS over the phone and got an automated message that my loan was transferred. The next day I called XXXX and they confirmed the loan was transferred to them and I was to pay them for XXXX and XXXX. I explained that I already paid XXXX through SLS and paid XX/XX/2021 to XXXX. I called SLS again to get them to transfer the payment to XXXX per the transferring of the loan. The first representative stated that the loan would be transferred within 7-10 business days. I followed up and called XXXX XX/XX/2021 to see if the payment was transferred and it was not. I followed up with SLS after on the same day and this new representative told me that the payment was transferred when the loan was transferred in XXXX and that I would need XXXX to investigate their payments to find the one for my account. I then called XXXX and they searched to see if any payments went through that were not yet associated to my loan, and there was none. I was then told SLS needs to investigate. I then called SLS and another rep they told me were not going to transfer the payment it was already applied to my loan through them since the loan was still with them the date of payment XX/XX/2021 and my loan was transferred XX/XX/2021. I called XXXX to explain and they said the loan was transferred in XXXX. I then called SLS to request documents/ records to prove so I could send to XXXX . This is what really makes me upset, SLS told me they did not have any records or documentation for my mortgage loan as they sent it all the XXXX when the loan was transferred. Furthermore, I tried two separate times with two separate representatives and asked to speak to a supervisor or manager or for the call to be escalated to someone who could get me the records. They would not transfer me to anyone higher up and stated they would put in a request for a supervisor to contact me within 72 hours. I asked if they could give me confirmation of the request or some way to know when I could expect this call and they said no. I then called XXXX again extremely upset that my mortgage transfer got so convoluted and no one could give me any answer as to why both companys are claiming that the transfer date is different and somehow XXXX still thinks I owe for XXXX, even though SLS told me the XXXX payment I made already went towards my mortgage loan. SLS should be sued, and I just might consider legal representation against them if they do not sort out where one of the companys went wrong in transferring my mortgage loan."

2223290,"Bank of America ( BofA ) has made negligent misrepresentations on a mortgage or Trust Deed and, with the continued use of such practices, have also made fraudulent misrepresentations on a mortgage or Trust Deed. By providing me with knowingly false information and representations related to the status of a mortgage or Deed of Trust, BofA is in violation of RESPA enforced by Regulation X ( Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) ), TILA enforced by Regulation Z ( CFPB ), the National Mortgage Settlement ( NMS ) enforceable by government agencies ( XXXX ) and consumer protection advocacy groups ( XXXX ), the California Homeowners XXXX enforced by California XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX through XXXX, the XXXX Code of the state of California that may be enforced through a private right of action in California XXXX Court, and the XXXX XXXX by engaging in racketeering business enterprise with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). 
BofA has retained outside legal counsel to respond to escalated cases on their behalf, but it is unclear if BofA has provided total access of records to their legal advisors so that a truthful opinion may be rendered based on the most current and available account information and documentation, including, but not limited to, electronically created and kept documents and data. While BofA has destroyed portions of the mortgage and service records in their attempts to create a false narrative of events over the past 56 months, there are documents and data available that make clear the events and actions that occurred throughout the loss mitigation processes. 
There is an established escrow account associated with this mortgage to pay all property insurances and property taxes. Monthly escrow account installment fees and charges are assessed as evidenced by the monthly mortgage installment statements to date. Unapplied escrow fees have been charged against the mortgage and claimed by the servicer as part of a delinquency resulting in the recording of the XX/XX/XXXX16 Notice of Default publicly beginning the foreclosure process. However, BofA has refused to pay the latest property insurances and property taxes timely or at all. The escrow account is still in place as it can not be dissolved per Making Homes Affordable, Homes Affordable Mortgage Program guidelines and related charges continue to be assessed but unpaid as required, intended, charged, and claimed. It is improper, unfair, and a poor and deceptive practice to assess and collect a monthly fee for property taxes and insurances and then not follow through with payment of property taxes and insurances. 
BofA, through their retained legal counsel, represented to me there is no principal balance associated with this home loan mortgage account while concurrently representing and maintaining the XX/XX/XXXX Trust Deed has defaulted and, as such, the foreclosure is proper and in accordance with all applicable regulations, guidelines, and laws including, but not limited to, the XXXX Code. I 've not been a mortgagor since XXXX. 
BofA knows I 'm a XXXX person living on a fixed income. If I 'm forced out of my home I will have no where to live and shelter myself as affordable housing is nonexistent. I will be made homeless and possibly a criminal due to the homeless state of existence. I provided BofA a timely request for mortgage assistance to prevent any delinquency and keep my home, not to be forcibly removed from my home and become homeless. I 'm living in a constant state of XXXX. I ca n't focus or sleep. I do n't eat. I over eat. This existence is ongoing and endless. This is my life now, a state of existence threatened by homelessness through wrongful foreclosure and racketeering."

XXXX said they closed the balances at an operating loss and had no need for reporting anymore so I discussed with them to remove the amounts but they said it was no longer within their hands because it was sent off to a 3rd party agency. This agency does not have the agreement however so it is stuck in limbo. Then finally, the XXXX XXXX Auto Loan that shows a missed payment is incorrect.

XXXX. I was eligible for four deferements as a result of the XXXX benefit.

I have since contacted XXXX to resolve this matter by phone with no resolution as well as disputing this account my credit report. All of these actions are in direct violation of the XXXX benefits available to me. My next step is to file a suit with the Department of Justice for non compliance of XXXX to assist me with these benefits and the unfair reposession and account balance that is now on my credit report. 

This inaccuracy needs to be removed immediately as I am entitled to my credit report being correct and free of inaccuracies. 

I am not seeking compensatory damages because the vehicle has already been sold and is now unreturnable. But I would like for this negative inaccurate account to be removed from my credit report immediately."

Nationstar then told me after several weeks that my paperwork is too old, and they do not have to accept the terms of my current modification and want to start their own modification. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Nationstar sent me a letter that they were doing a XXXX XXXX modification because I was not eligible for a HAMP modification.

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I went to see XXXX XXXX XXXX, a bankruptcy attorney about filing for chapter XXXX bankruptcy.

The packet was sent viapriority mail so that they would have a hard copy and and we would have a copyin our records. Everything we send seems to be missing or they can not read it. 
We have submitted paystubs again because they can not read what was sent. 
This time we have faxed again and submitted a hard copy priority mail. 
With a tracking number and signature needed again. Even my Hud agent isbaffled by the way Beneficial has handled our hardship. They have changed our pointof contact several times. When we finally received confirmation thatthey have all documents and they can read them on a XXXX way call. 
They change the point of contact and say they need more and now thethe point of contact can not communicate with my HUD agent. 
Which is really confusing when she has a XXXX party approval. She is myHUD representative. They even had us fill out XXXX party forms XXXX because theyclaimed that the formed expired even though it says it is good fora year. However, it expired after 6 months. Now they say that it is therepolicy they do not talk with XXXX part reps. That she now has to talkdirectly to Loss Mid directly. Why do the rules keep changing. 
Everytime they call or send a letter it states how they want to workwith me and give HUD numbers and then they give us this completerun around. I have come to the conclusion that they think if they keepmaking us jump through hoops and basically giving blood test andnothing is going to work because they think we will just give upour home with out a fight. I love my home and will work hard to keep it. 
My percent rate has been a 10 %. I have already basically paid for myhome once and with percent rates as low as they are you think theycould help us as they state every letter and phone call. All I amasking for is a lower percent rate and obviously a lower payment some and my family and keep our home. We are a working family. 
I work anywhere from XXXX to XXXX hrs a week. I am not on welfare. I paymy taxes and make donations to those in need. What else dothey need. Please help"

Once the XXXX months were up our rate went back to 6 % and we could no longer afford to make the payments. We tried working with Wells Fargo but they would not help us so we hired the XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX to work with Wells Fargo.

We do not want to lose our home where we raised our children. We are requesting that Wells Fargo permanently modify our loan so we can continue to make payments and stay in our home.

This week I got the debit card in the mail and when I tried to call to activate it, I was told that my account was closed by Schwab, without notice, because I had no activity in 6 months.

I also said that I needed this to be resolved ASAP as I was going abroad in a week and needed access to my account before then. After speaking to another representative who said she would look into it, call me back, and then never did. I reached out again and spoke to a supervisor, XXXX, who said he would look into it an call me back. 
XXXX called back and left a message saying that it is in their terms of service that they can cancel anyone 's account without notice and, even though the rep I spoke to two weeks ago said everything was fine, if I wanted a new account I  would have to go through the application process again ( and have another inquiry on my credit report ) for an account that should have never been closed in the first place.

I have encountered severe discrepancies and violations in my credit reports, which are seriously impacting my financial well-being and quality of life. 

XXXX XXXX - Account Number : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX I have meticulously reviewed my credit reports and discovered that both XXXX  XXXX and XXXX have reported inaccurate information regarding the payment history of my accounts ( Account Numbers : XXXX and XXXX ). To the best of my knowledge, these accounts have never been paid late. The inaccurate reporting from these creditors is tarnishing my creditworthiness, making it exceedingly difficult for me to secure favorable financing terms for essential life needs.

These inaccuracies have had a profound impact on my personal life. For instance, my dream of purchasing a home for my family has been delayed indefinitely due to the unfavorable credit terms I am now being offered. The emotional distress and constant worry caused by these incorrect credit reports have also taken a toll on my mental health. The hopelessness I feel when facing seemingly insurmountable obstacles created by these reporting errors is difficult to put into words. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX - Account Number : XXXX Furthermore, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Account Number : XXXX ) has failed to note that this account was in dispute within the stipulated XXXX period, thereby violating the provisions set forth in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) under 15 U.S. Code 1692e ( 8 ). This oversight on their part has caused further distress and frustration, as I expected my rights under the FDCPA to be upheld.

Additionally, I have noticed numerous unauthorized credit inquiries on my credit reports, including but not limited to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX These unauthorized inquiries have led to an invasion of my privacy and potential exposure to fraudulent activity, causing me significant anxiety.

Given the aforementioned violations of FCRA, FDCPA, and other related laws, I kindly request your intervention to rectify these issues promptly. Specifically, I implore you to ensure that the following actions are taken : XXXX XXXX and XXXX must rectify their inaccurate reporting of payment history on accounts XXXX and XXXX, respectively. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX must amend their record to reflect that account XXXX was in dispute within the stipulated XXXX period, as required by the FDCPA. 
All unauthorized credit inquiries, as mentioned above, must be promptly removed from my credit reports to restore my privacy and protect me from potential identity theft. 
As I navigate these challenges, I want to stress the profound emotional toll these violations have taken on my life. The dream of providing stability and a secure future for my family seems increasingly distant due to circumstances beyond my control. The XXXX, frustration, and sleepless nights that I endure due to these errors are a constant reminder of the uphill battle I face. 

I kindly request your prompt attention to this matter and urge you to use your authority to ensure that creditors and credit reporting agencies comply with the law. Your intervention would not only bring me the relief I desperately seek but also help restore my faith in the financial system that should protect consumers like me. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your prompt response and resolution of these issues. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"

Recent findings by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) have raised concerns about Experians compliance with these legal obligations.

Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), Experian is required to conduct a thorough and reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items within 30 days. Additionally, per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable must be promptly deleted or corrected. Failure to comply with these legal requirements constitutes a violation of federal law.

I hereby request that Experian : 1. Conduct a thorough reinvestigation of the following disputed accounts or items : [ List each disputed account or item, including account numbers if available. ] 2. Provide all documentation used to verify the accuracy of the disputed information.

3. Correct or delete any inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information as required by law.

Enclosed, please find copies of my identification and supporting documents to facilitate your investigation. Given the CFPBs recent findings, I expect Experian to handle this dispute with the utmost seriousness and in full compliance with FCRA requirements.

Please respond to this dispute in writing within the legally required timeframe. Should Experian fail to fulfill its obligations, I am prepared to escalate this matter to the appropriate regulatory authorities and consider further legal action if necessary.

I have reviewed my consumer credit file and identified multiple material violations regarding the reporting of the above-referenced account.

The following violations are clear, willful, and actionable : 1. Reporting Past Due Amount After Charge-Off Metro 2 guidelines state that after a charge-off, the Past Due Amount should be reported as {$0.00}. 
Your reporting reflects a {$140.00} past due amount in XX/XX/XXXX despite the account being charged off in XX/XX/XXXX. This is inaccurate, misleading, and noncompliant with both XXXX XXXX and FCRA 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). 
XXXX. Re-Aging of Account The Date of First Delinquency ( DOFD ) is XX/XX/XXXX, yet you updated the balance in XX/XX/XXXX as if new delinquency occurred. This constitutes illegal re-aging under FCRA XXXX ( c ) and is a deceptive reporting practice designed to extend the derogatory impact beyond the XXXX reporting limit. 
XXXX. Improper Payment History After XXXX XXXX XXXX requires that once an account is charged off, payment history reporting should cease updating with new CO notations. Your report shows multiple CO entries month after month post-charge-off, which is a willful misrepresentation intended to make the account appear in continual delinquency. 
XXXX. Failure to Properly Code Consumer Dispute During my dispute, the account should have been coded with the XXXX XXXX Compliance Condition Code XB and reporting frozen until resolution. Instead, you continued to report derogatory information without proper dispute notation, violating FCRA 623 ( a ) ( 3 ).

5. Highest Balance Misrepresentation The account is reported with a {$220.00} highest balance on a {$200.00} limit. If this is not factually accurate, it constitutes false and misleading reporting under FCRA XXXX ( b ). 
Demand for Action You are hereby demanded to : 1. 2. Delete the above-referenced account from all consumer reporting agencies, OR Correct all violations listed above in full compliance with XXXX XXXX XXXX and the FCRA, and provide written proof of such corrections. 
Failure to comply within 15 days of receipt of this letter will result in my immediate initiation of a civil lawsuit seeking statutory damages of no less than {$1000.00} per violation under 15 U.S.C.

Inexplicably, Ally Bank refused to resolve the dispute in my favor, even though : ( 1 ) the gym stated that they wanted me to dispute it with my bank and that they would allow the dispute to rule in my favor ; ( 2 ) the gym 's continued possession of the {$310.00} is a breach of contract and a violation of contract law ( as it was a month-to-month agreement where I voluntarily prepaid for 12 months ) ; and ( 3 ) my bank has an obligation to address issues of fraud and, since the gym made a written admission as to the fraudulent categorization of the monies paid, this dispute involved fraud. Despite all of my best efforts, Ally Bank repeatedly and willfully misconstrued basic facts, duties and obligations, and the law. Even though I haven't had a locker with the gym since the end of XX/XX/XXXX ( having terminated my month-to-month rental agreement ), the gym has unlawfully kept {$310.00} of my money and Ally Bank has refused to act appropriately."

5836161,"My name is XXXX XXXX and my loan is serviced by United Wholesale Mortgage. 
My loan number is XXXX. 

I have previously made a complaint regarding United Wholesale Mortgage, different than this one. 

Because I made the complaint on CFPB website and also closed a loan modification agreement with the investors ( XXXX XXXX ) for a lower interest rate than the one offered by United Wholesale Mortgage, the mortgage servicer provider ( UWM ) RETALIATES against me. 

They have OVERCHARGED my ESCROW account by applying {$9100.00} that represents a full amount for the entire billing cycle for a year starting XX/XX/XXXX. I repeat starting XX/XX/XXXX, a full year ESCROW shortage for a SHORTAGE that doesn't exist but "" will eventually exist starting XX/XX/XXXX "" ( according to their absolute misleading escrow analysis ). 
My payments have been established through the loan modification contract and already includes the payments for the ESCROW. 
Before we closed the contract, UWM have sent me a letter ( same letter they sent to the investors- please see attached ) in which is clearly specified the monthly payment of {$1800.00}. 
This payment includes : Principal & Interest {$1100.00} + ESCROW : {$710.00} + Monthly escrow shortage : {$46.00}. 
I have agreed to pay this. 
After we close the contract for the loan modification and made my first payment of {$1800.00}, United Wholesale Mortgage made another "" ESCROW ANALYSIS "" by which reflects that starting XX/XX/XXXX my ESCROW ACCOUNT will have a SHORTAGE of {$9100.00}. 
Reason why they have divided this amount to 12 months and they add to my monthly billing starting XX/XX/XXXX another {$760.00} for the "" XXXX XXXX "". 
The TOTAL now for a month is {$2600.00}.

Can you just imagine this? : They charge 2 years AHEAD for the ESCROW SHORTAGE that didn't even occurred. 
Why do we still have a loan modification agreement if they can do whatever they want and charge years ahead whenever they want? 
Who stops this company from abusive practices against me? 
If they did an ESCROW analysis in the beginning, why did they do another one AFTER we CLOSED the contract? 
Is this legal? Is this abusive practice industry standard? 

My understanding is that I can be required to pay a part of the estimated annual total in advance, but no more than a maximum of XXXX of the total. 

Moreover, UWM is hiding this particular bill dated XX/XX/XXXX by which they have OVERCHARGED THE ESCROW ACCOUNT. 

THIS PARTICULAR BILL WAS SENT TO ME BUT IS MISSING FROM THE ONLINE DOCUMENT CENTER. - please see attached. 

WHAT WOULD YOU DO BELIEVE IF YOU WERE IN MY SHOES?! 

Please STOP retaliating against me! Please STOP the constant abuse to OVERCHARGE me!

The young was very nice but in the process of replacing the card the wrong account was attached. I returned to the branch the following day requesting that the setup of the card be reviewed because transactions were posting on the both accounts. I pointed a hotel charge and advised which account it should post. The associate could not figure out why the item was showing on both accounts. She said she would have her manager give me a call. She went on the say that the issue with the card had been resolved. 
Despite her efforts, the card issue remained unresolved and daily expenses and travel expenses were being debited from the operating account not the secondary account. 
I then called the toll free customer service line to escalate the matter. I called them 3 or 4 times on several days and was told that they could see mo issue with the card. The card then worked for purchases but not at the ATM. Each time we were reassured that the card was only connected to the secondary account and not the operating account. We stopped seeing transactions on the operating account and so we thought what we were being told was accurate. 
We never received a call back from the local manager to discuss the charges that posted to the wrong account so we were reluctant to make deposits. We were monitoring the accounts for the appropriate adjustments to be made so that we could begin to use the account again. Not only did PNC Bank fail to make the adjustment, they determined that we were not worth banking and decided to initiate the close of our operating account. 
At the point that the closure was done, the card that was never to be connected with the operating account was closed too. They were dishonest stating that the card was no longer connected to the operating account when in fact it was. 
Its disturbing that a so called reputable institution was unable to replace a simple debit card and no one took the time to look at all facets of our requests and concerns. 
I spent a total of 6 hours on the road going to and from the closest branch ( 4 visits ) and at least 7 hours on multiple calls working with people who could not resolve the issue. 
We are incredibly dissatisfied that they failed to make the appropriate adjustment because of their bankers mistake or systems malfunction. That coupled with service providers that dont care of enough to return a call. 
It is concerning that they had time to review the account to determine closure but they didnt have time to review the account to address the situation they caused. 
I have requested that they review the decision. I was given to a voicemail and told they may not call back. Im certainly accustomed to them not calling back and not following through. 
We are not new clients. Were account owners before PNC merged with RBC. Of course none of that matters.

Transfer and Documentation : In XX/XX/XXXX, my mortgage was transferred to Roundpoint Mortgage, with all necessary documentation, including escrow balances and insurance payment information, provided by XXXX XXXX. 

XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX : Roundpoint Mortgage failed to renew my homeowner 's insurance policy, resulting in a lapse from XX/XX/XXXX until I managed to resolve the issue on XX/XX/XXXX. Roundpoint attributed their failure to "" not knowing who to pay, '' despite having received comprehensive transfer documentation. 

Communication Issues : Despite being informed via letter of the lapse, I was unable to address the issue until XX/XX/XXXX due to being out of town. Subsequently, I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, indicating a punitive fee of {$600.00} for the lapsed period, a rate significantly higher than market standards. 

( Note : That fee is well above market and predatory. The new annual policy fee I am paying for a year 's worth of coverage is {$1000.00} ; or {$2.00} per day. Their purposed "" estimate '' equates to {$11.00} per day and covers a period in the past that accompanies XXXX claims on the property. ) - In response, today, XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, I called my new insurer ( XXXX ) and asked if they could backdate the coverage. They can not. That vehicle is not available to me as a consumer. Not a product I can buy on the free market. 

- I then called RoundPoint to discuss the issue and ask how to remedy it, and on the recorded line, was told by their rep that if I could provide documentation that they knew who to pay to renew my insurance, by the end of the week, the fee and penalty would be removed. 

- I then called the insurance company and the previous mortgage servicer and was able to find and, am in receipt of, such documentation. XXXX XXXX  sent me the documentation that was sent with the transfer that indicates my escrow balance and the XXXX renewal and fees due to renew the policy with my insurance company ( XXXX XXXX ). 

- I called RoundPoint back asking where to send that documentation to have the fee and lapse removed. I was connected with a different representative who told me that her scripted template only permitted her to tell me that the fee would be charged unless i could provide proof of insurance for the lapsed period. She said she was unable to provide me with any route to share the information I had collected and that documentation would do 'nothing to resolve ' the issue. 

- I asked for a copy of the recorded transcript and notes on from calls. She replied she was unable to do that. 

XXXX asked for an email address where I could deliver the documentation I was in receipt of that clearly demonstrates they were in receipt of my insurer payee and the amount due and when it was due. She replied she was unable to do that. 

-I asked her to put in writing and send to me via email that they are telling me that they had no record of where to send the money I had paid in full and was stored in my escro account for the explicit purpose of procuring homeowner 's insurance and that is why they are charging me well above market rates for a product that does not exist to consumers, but would not accept such proof. Only proof that I had the insurance during those dates would remove the fees. She replied she was unable to do that and was restricted to the scripted language that essentially mirrored the letter I received. 

Conclusion : The documentation I possess, commonly transferred between mortgage processors, clearly details the allocation of escrow funds for insurance. Roundpoint 's failure to act on this information, combined with their refusal to acknowledge evidence and impose exorbitant fees, underscores a lack of accountability and predatory practices. As a consumer, I am left with no recourse to rectify this situation through reasonable means, highlighting a significant fault on Roundpoint 's part."

I called the customer service number, which was almost completely automated and made it extremely difficult to speak to a person.

She explained to me that I was not allowed to use the account for things like XXXX, paying bills, etc. I asked what the reason for that was and she reiterated that it just was not allowed and I could only transfer to another bank account. 

This seems extremely restrictive and there is really no good reason that I shouldn't be able to access my funds in any way I choose. This makes me especially anxious when considering Marcus has no physical locations. A transfer to my checking account takes a couple days and any other method that I might utilize my money, say by paying an urgent bill or unexpected expense is just "" not allowed '' makes it seem like they are trying to implement rules for the sake of keeping the funds locked up tight. Although it is a savings, not a checking account, there are many, many conceivable reasons a person would need to access the funds in a way other than straight to a checking account. Further, it is not the Bank 's duty to police the ways in which a person can access their funds. XXXX nefarious activity, people should be free to access their funds in any way they choose. 
I'll be closing the account so it will no longer apply to me, but it should be noted that Marcus is being unnecessarily restrictive in their use of other peoples ' money."
