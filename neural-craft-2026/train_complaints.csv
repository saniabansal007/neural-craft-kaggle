We tried and did everything the bank ( specialized loan service ( SLS ) wanted us to do. They finally offered us a program called DEED IN LIEU instead of a foreclosure. we accepted this and they even paid us under their cash for keys program which is only given out for deed of lieu or short sales. 5 1/2 years later when we are applying for a new mortgage an open foreclosure is showing up on our credit report instead of deed in lieu from this bank SLS. After numerous talks with different departments within the company, faxes, written requests and a copy of out credit report so this error can be corrected on our credit report, me and my wife are getting nothing but a run around. I had XXXX different customer service reps and a dept manager say that our file looked messed up, that it should be reading one way but reads another way. They all said they do n't know where to begin. 

We showed them the proof, they saw the proof in their files. The manager even said a deed in lieu was started but never completed. They see the cash for keys check issued ( XXXX XXXX, 2010 ) and a copy of the deeds and verification of mortgage. We really need help with this and have no where else to turn. 

This is the only thing prohibiting us from obtaining a new mortgage. Our credit is outstanding except for this mark on our credit report. We can not get them to help us fix their error.

I was told by the agent that I had to attempt a short sale XXXX for XXXX before a Deed and XXXX could be considered. Speeding up on the same subject, about XXXX months ago I requested information for a short sale. The information provided had all work out options including Deed in Lieu. I read the information for a Deed in Lieu and it did not say anything about having to do a short sale. I called again and spoke to a representative and agreed with what the paperwork said. She tried to go back in the notes to see why he would tell me that but she said she said since my account transferred to a new system, she did n't have access to anything earlier than XXXX 2014. How convenient. She said I can still attempt a Deed in Lieu but since my house is already up for sale I just wanted to finish out this option first. After submitting the shortsale information, I received correspondence stating that they received my request for a loan modification and I will receive additional information for what is needed. I clearly filled out the information for short sale and not a modification. I added the information for my realtor and her contact information, giving permission to speak with her. Then I received a letter from an Attorney basically suing me and I had to respond to the Answer, which I did. I called last Wednesday and the lady at the law firm could not find anything for me, not even a file. She transferred me to XXXX which just happened to be a mailbox, I explained I just wanted to verify again that it was received. If not, then I can fax the information over. I did not receive a call back, letter or anything. What I did receive today was a Motion for Default Judgment because I failed to respond. I called the law firm again and they were closed. I called the mortgage company, and of course he had no information on file. He suggested I speak with the short sale department and explain the judgment to see what has happened. He transferred me and they were closed. I ca n't deal with them on my own anymore. I keep trying to do the right thing and just not walk away, and sell the house and not leave it empty, but I still keep getting the incorrect information. That is not fair to me at all.

2105836,"I am writing another complaint against Wells Fargo. This is complaint # 4. I do n't understand why Wells Fargo is trying to waste my time when I am merely trying to save my home. I have asked you to provide confirmation on who actually was the investor of this property. I have been told the FHA was the investor. Then, I was told Wells Fargo was the investor.This went on for 5 years. Now, XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo 's lastadmission was that XXXX was the investor. Can you please stop wasting my time and give me an answer that is not full of lies? 
You may want to know why this is so important to me. The answer is simple. 1. ) I had an FHA loan. 2. ) I paid for mortgage insurance. 3. ) I should have been able to use FHA money through their Partial Claims. 4. ) The LENDER ( or investor ) has to initiate the partial claims paperwork. 
Wells Fargo REFUSED to initiate the paperwork stating that they were not the lender. That was a lie. Had Wells Fargo not lied to me, and filled out the paperwork for Partial Claims, this foreclosure would have been stopped. Now, they are saying I never submitted the paperwork needed. WHAT?????? Lie after lie, after lie. 
My last point of contact for Wells Fargo was XXXX XXXX. After I read XXXX ' answers to my questions, I thought I was on the show "" XXXX. '' I could not believe the ridiculous answers I received. I submitted paperwork that contradicts everything in your answers.After contacting Wells Fargo and asking to speak to a supervisor, I was given another point of contact named XXXX XXXX. At first, he seemed very concerned with my issues and stated that he was going to do every thing he can to get to the bottom of this. I wanted to speak to XXXX again but, for some reason, he is never in the office and after leaving several messages on HIS PERSONAL VOICEMAIL, I have yet to hear from him. 
Now XXXX told me that if there were any improprieties, Wells Fargo would do what they could to resolve my issues and work with me to get my home back. He sounded so sincere that I actually believed him. Thank goodness my common sense told me to become a member of auction.com and to add this address to my saved list. So, I was a little upset when I received an email from XXXX that this property was available to bid on. Auction starts XX/XX/XXXXand is overXX/XX/XXXX. Starting bid is {$2500.00}. When I called XXXXon XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, to discuss this, his whole attitude changed and he stated that he NEVER said Wells Fargo would reverse anything. Then, after telling him I have the whole conversation on tape, he stated that he could no longer talk to me if I was recording him. The first thing you 're told when you call Wells Fargo, is that you are on a recorded line.What 's the differencebetween YOUR recordedconversation or mine? Maybe they want to edit their tapes later but ca n't if there 's another recording out there. Makes you wonder. 
So my question is, how are you looking for improprieties which could reverse this foreclosure and at the same time, put this property on the auction block? I do n't know if the "" dual tracking '' laws would pertain to this but lets see what the OCC, CFBP, and THE Federal Trade Commission think about it. Remember, I have EVERY conversation recorded, just like you. Before you answer, you may want to go back and listen to your own recorded messages. 
Please stop the auction until you finish your investigation. I 'm trying to get my home back and it appears that you, Wells Fargo is doing everything in your power to circumvent my due diligence. Also, please find my mortgage modification packet from XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. That would be the packet submitted in court and handed to your Attorney, XXXX XXXX.

I have a number of student loans that I would like to make revolving payments on. However, it is extremely frustrating and overwhelming that my student loan total balance has increased from {$80.00} and tripled ( approximately 2 times the amount than the original balance ), resulting in me now owing {$150.00}. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, in the effort of trying to resolve my student loan balance, I entered into a student loan recovery program with XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). The agreement was that I had to pay {$630.00} for nine ( 9 ) months. On the tenth ( 10th ) month the agreement was that the payment would be reduced to a more affordable payment, which was to be paid directly to XXXX and no longer to XXXX. 

Each time I tried to talk to XXXX about lowering my payment and after the 9th payment I continuously received the run around. Unfortunately, once I completed the 9th payment and the loan was sent back to XXXX, I was told that the payment could NOT be lowered and the {$630.00} will need to be continued. I told XXXX that I only agreed to the payment for 9 months knowing that it would be reduced on the 10th month. I advised XXXX that I could pay $ 200 monthly. XXXX would not accept a lower payment amount. 

Please know that I am fully aware that this is my student loan and it is my reasonability to repay the loan. However, because XXXX would not take a lower payment, as we were dealing with financial difficulty during that time, I was unable to continue the {$630.00} payments to XXXX. 

Now in XX/XX/XXXX XXXX continued to add fees to my balance, sold my account to XXXX XXXX , XXXX who ALSO STACKED on additional fees resulting in my student loan going form {$80.00} to now owing {$150.00}. When I called XXXX XXXX, XXXX and spoke with the collector of my student loan, I asked her what was the lowest amount that I could pay. She advised me that the payment was {$1800.00} per month. When I pulled out my calculator and multiplied {$1800.00} by 180 months equals to me actually paying back {$320000.00} when I only borrowed {$80.00}. You do the math as "" THIS IS INSANE. '' To be honest, I was in shock where I actually almost fell off the chair. 

I told her that I could not pay {$1800.00} a month and I will need a much lower amount. She never asked me any questions regarding my expenses and nor did she provide me with an itemized statement as to where did all theses fees come from. Additionally, my XXXX tax return was garnished by XXXX and or XXXX XXXX, XXXX She was unable to provide me with an itemized statement as to where the funs were applied. Matter of fact, she simply advised me that there was NO room for negotiation and the payment amount is {$1800.00} per month, and became unresponsive on the phone and basically hung up on me. 

Next, I proceeded to call XXXX, hoping that I was gong to get some assistance. I spoke with a young man who started yelling at me as I was trying to explain to him my situation and how the loan has tripled ( 3 times the amount ) from what I originally borrowed. He told me in a very loud tone of voice that "" this is your responsibility and you need to pay your loans.

I received an email from Upgrade notifying me that my checking account had been suspended without warning. At the time, my account contained {$2400.00}. I was given no explanation for the suspension and was told by customer service that no action was required on my part and that I would receive an update within 90 days.

I now have no access to any of my funds to pay for bills, groceries, utilities, and other essential living expenses. This is my only source of available income, and the continued hold is creating severe and immediate financial hardship.

The only unusual activity that occurred before the suspension was that I initiated two wire transfers to myself on consecutive days. Both transactions were fully verified and confirmed as authorized by me. Despite this, Upgrade has continued to hold 100 % of my balance without providing a reason or a specific resolution timeline.

I believe this indefinite hold on my account and failure to provide access to my own funds may constitute violations of federal consumer protection laws, including : Regulation CC ( 12 CFR Part 229 ) which establishes maximum permissible hold periods for deposited funds.

Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA, 15 U.S.C. 1693 et seq. ) which protects consumers rights to access their accounts and funds in a timely manner.

I have repeatedly requested an expedited review or at least a partial release of my funds, but Upgrade has refused. They have stated only that my case has been escalated but will not provide a timeline for resolution.

I am requesting that the CFPB assist in ensuring Upgrade either : 1. Provides a clear and specific explanation for the suspension and a definitive resolution date ; or 2. Releases my funds immediately so I can meet basic living expenses while their review is ongoing.

The below statements all have documentation as support : -- My previous mortgage lender was XXXX XXXX -- Due to Covid impact on my income, I accepted an offer for a forbearance plan from XXXX XXXX in XXXX of XXXX. -- I did due diligence and was assured that several re-payment plans would be offered at the end of the forbearance. The forbearance was due to End on XXXX XXXX,, XXXX. All paperwork was done in time for the consideration of loan modification. -- My loan was sold to Fay Servicing on XX/XX/XXXX. -- I called Fay Servicing three times ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) trying to resume payments on time and was put off; told that my information was not yet in their system. -- In a subsequent phone conversation I was told that they received my loan on XX/XX/XXXX. -- I called on XXXX XXXX, attempting to make a payment, which was refused, and I was given a link to an online application for assistance with a modification. I began the application process immediately. -- I called again on XXXX XXXX, to make a payment, which was again declined. -- I reached out to XXXX XXXX XXXX that day about a refinance and spoke with XXXX who confirmed that Fay is trying to force a foreclosure ; it is illegal to refuse to take a payment, and that Fay would know I can not refinance without 3 consecutive on time payments. -- I called numerous times between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and finally found someone who unwittingly took a payment for {$810.00}. -- On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a packet in the mail saying I was in default and foreclosure proceedings were beginning. -- I called beginning on XXXX XXXX, to make a payment and was told that only one person could take my payment : XXXX XXXX. I left messages for XXXX on XXXX XXXX and XXXX with no response. -- As of XXXX XXXX, I have spoken with XXXX twice and an unnamed woman once. Neither who will take a payment and neither who could track down XXXX. -- XXXX XXXX, I received a notice of default from Fay Servicing, postmarked on XX/XX/XXXX, dated on XX/XX/XXXX ; FIVE DAYS AFTER I made a payment. -- XX/XX/XXXX. I have spoken with XXXX at XXXX and have forwarded all paperwork. He says that XXXX is Double tracking which is illegal. They are using crossover dates, which create an impossible scenario for me to navigate. -- XX/XX/XXXX I am informed that I have been approved for a forbearance, and no payments are currently due. I forward this to XXXX at XXXX for clarification on this. -- XX/XX/XXXX. Called Fay servicing and after over an hour of transfers, I spoke with XXXX XXXX, who explained that the forbearance is for one month only and I am now allowed to pay whatever you can prior to XX/XX/XXXX, after which time no payments will be accepted. After the XXXX, I will be given an opportunity to re-apply, from scratch, for a new plan. I told XXXX I would like to make a payment this day and she said only an account manager can take my payment ; none of which were available and she told me to call back. I told XXXX, and I believe it was noted, that what is going on is clearly back-handed legal maneuver, and I refuse to be forced into foreclosure. -- XX/XX/XXXX. I have been on the phone, hours here and there, trying to make a payment. Have talked to several people but then am put back into a hold queue, supposedly for an account manager. I have left messages, none have been returned. It is literally impossible for me to make a payment with a live person and the website has now changed and I need a new account as my old one has been deleted? Note : All references relating to my particular account manager, XXXX XXXX at his number are added to a generic phone loop that does not go anywhere. It asks for account number, reason for call, etc. over and over and never ends up either with a person, or with the ability to make an online payment. I have never spoken with a XXXX XXXX, nor has he ever returned any messages that took hours to leave with various other people. -- XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX P.M. In person appointment with attorney, XXXX XXXX. He went over all of my paperwork and agreed that there were illegal practices occurring ; said he would write a letter, may end up going to court, kept all paperwork for copies. He suggested I hand mail a payment in, as I have it in writing that payments will be accepted until XX/XX/XXXX. I mailed a payment out the following morning ( Check # XXXX ) I regret not sending it certified. -- XX/XX/XXXX. Received from Fay Servicing, my un-cashed check, stamped received by them on XX/XX/XXXX. The check was refused due to the pre-foreclosure status. 

The company ( FAY ) responded to this complaint on XX/XX/XXXX. Fay Servicing 's response to my initial complaint fully supports that they are employing illegal tactics to try to force me into foreclosure, and it also proves them to be a corrupt and dishonest operation. These two quotes have been taken from their response, with an attached letter from them dated XX/XX/XXXX ( BEFORE their response ) which directly contradicts their claims. 

In your complaint, you state that Fay is attempting to move forward with foreclosure proceedings. 

Please be advised your loan has not been referred to foreclosure. 

The rest of their reply amounts to mostly confusing fluff, along with how to set up an online account which I did a long time ago and is unusable due to my FORECLOSURE STATUS that they continue to deny. The phone number they give is the same number in my complaint in which I am placed into a never-ending phone loop without any sort of resolution. I will allow their own letter ( attached ) speak for itself in regard to their blatantly dishonest and inaccurate response to my complaint.",Mortgage,Trouble during payment process,1

This lead me to actually understand what a bond and instrument really is. Which I found the legal definitions in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX edition to be exact. This affidavit of truth has went unrebutted. I requested that they respond back to me via notarized mail only which is how I communicated with them. Yet they continue to send me the alleged statements in the mail and text my phone. I gave them 10 days in the letter to respond back which they did not. I then sent them over an Affidavit of Default stating that they have committed trust fraud through this TRUST transaction and that I am the living woman/soul of this alleged debt that they are stating that I owe. To settle this debt I then sent them a 1099A indorsed by me ( the beneficiary ), along with that I provided them with instructions on how to use the 1099OID,1040V, and1096. I have waited over 30 days for a response and still have not been successful with remedy. I took it upon myself to call and speak with someone. I spoke with XXXX who is the alleged supervisor over the account. I was asked why I "" thought that they property was "" abandoned ''. From my knowledge according to XXXX XXXX XXXX abandon mean to relinquish or give up with intent of never again resuming or claiming ones rights or interest. I questioned him about the alleged "" loan '' ( which I could not seem to find in the legal dictionary ) that was said to have been given to me because I did not recall any alleged funds being placed in my hand nor account. I have been mislead with them attempting to use the words "" loan, contract, and retail installment sales contract '' to confuse me. He stated that the funds was transferred over to the dealership ( XXXX XXXX ). I stated to him that the transferring of funds was never disclosed to me which violates Truth In Lending Act. I requested the 1099OID and an on/off ledger balance and was told that they can not provide me with this. They have failed to report the taxes on their "" income '' that they have received. They have been compensated from the TRUST account also while receiving funds that I have sent through my checking account meaning they have been double paid. I also requested EVERYTHING in the file that they have with en legis name on it assumed to be me the living woman/soul. I have also sent XXXX XXXX the same notices which have went unrebutted. This has lead me to believe that that XXXX fraud has been committed and they have failed to withhold their fiduciary obligation unto me ( the living soul/woman ). They have willingly and knowingly failed to disclose unto me that any alleged funds were transferred over to the dealership. They have led me to believe that I owe such said amount on a vehicle that I am not sure if the dealership added on any additional fees.

I have never lived at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NJ XXXX, yet this address has appeared on my credit profile without my knowledge or consent. 
I strongly believe that individuals who obtained my personal information have been using it to fraudulently open credit cards and loans. It appears they are receiving mailed credit offers to this address and using my identity to apply for credit. This has led to multiple unauthorized hard inquiries being placed on my credit report. 

Furthermore, I believe this activity may be related to the Equifax data breach in XXXX, during which my sensitive information including my full name, Social Security number, and date of birth may have been exposed. This breach has significantly increased the risk of identity theft for millions of consumers, myself included. 

Currently, the individuals committing this fraud appear to be actively making payments on the fraudulent accounts. Because of this, I have not yet filed a police report doing so prematurely may alert them and cause them to stop payments, which could damage my credit further and make investigation more difficult. I plan to file a police report once Ive secured my credit profile and can proceed strategically.

Despite this, I have not authorized any of the recent credit inquiries and am requesting that all inquiries made without my knowledge or consent be immediately removed from my credit report.

First, from XXXX XXXX, XXXX to XXXX XXXX, XXXX, we reviewed your account XXXX times for possible payment assistance options. FHA guidelines require that you occupy the property as your primary residence. Your account didn '' t meet the guildelines since your account was not listed as your primary residence. 
My response was the bank executive customer recovery group lie. This property is listed as my primary residence. My driver license, my voter registration card, my utility bills, my car registration, my termite bound, my car insurance, and lawn care company, all have the same address. In addition, my tax return had the same address. Furthermore, I paid State tax in Georgia. The house was my primary residence. 

Second : I have submitted all requested documents for the modification and they are requesting new documents. 
The bank said that we are unable to initiate another review for available payment assistance options prior to foreclosure sale date of XXXX XXXX, XXXX, because we did not receive proof of occupancy. 
My response was the package had my XXXX Federal and State Tax returns. Also, included a copy of my driver license. If a utility bill was requested, I could have sent it tooThird : I requested that Wells Fargo rescinded the sale of XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
Wells Fargo said that due to the outstanding items listed above, we require more time to resolve your inquiry, but will have a final resolution to you by XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

Yesterday, XXXX XXXX, the bank representative, XXXX XXXX told me that the sale is final and she will send it in writing to my address XXXX XXXX which was the residence and the mailing address listed with Wells Fargo in the recorded conversation. 
I disagree vehemently with the bank action. As you can verify in their own letter they did not initiate a review of the XXXX completed Federal application submitted on XXXX XXXX, Moreover, they did not review the internal Wells Fargo own application for assistance. Their own appeal form which authorized the customer right to a review was denied. 

At this point, the bank has violated my right to a review of the Federal application HAMP. Then,. I requested to XXXX XXXX of Wells Fargo if there is any other way to save my house. There was no answer. The only reason I was fighting for my house was I removed money form retirement account to keep the house during the depression.

XXXX. During XXXX of my Loan Mods, XXXX XXXX, my Attorney, XXXX XXXX XXXX, was notified of a loan {$210000.00}, 2 % int, at XXXX yrs. I was told I did n't qualify, I did n't make enough money. I got a renter in XXXX XXXX, this added {$600.00} to my monthly income, I got a signed rental contract, money order stubs, rental deposits in my bank acct, this was all sent to WF. I repeatedly asked for this to be revisited, to get a copy of this loan in writing, along with how they figured the equation. I never received anything. 
2. WF did an XXXX on my home, stated it was worth {$290000.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I spoke to my Home Preservation Specialist ( HPS ), XXXX XXXX XXXX about having an appraiser walk through my home. WF agreed on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to have me pay for an appraisal. I got XXXX from XXXX CT Appraisals, a formal appraisal was done & stated its value is {$160000.00}, a difference of {$130000.00} from the AVM.I built it during the housing bubble & it has steadily lost value. 
3. I was advised to make 3 good faith payments of {$1800.00} starting XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, which I did. I repeatedly told them this amount was not sustainable long term. During this time they were to review my modification. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I received a new loan mod of {$310000.00}, {$1800.00} mo, 4.125 % int, for XXXX yrs. My new XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, pushed me to sign it. I did not. During the XXXX of XXXX I repeatedly called, asked him many questions, I wanted to be sent certain documents he said he would look into it, & call me back, he never did. I called him weekly. I was never given any info on how under a hardship they could come up with this new loan mod amount. 
4. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I spoke to XXXX XXXX from WF. She informed me the appraisal was never looked at. It was received after the date that all of the XXXX XXXX paperwork was due. During that time, I was working with XXXX XXXX XXXX. He told me several times over the phone not to worry about the deadline, to get the appraisal done & all of the paperwork sent in. I sent it as soon as the appraisal was done. I was never made aware that the modification packet was turned in late. It was my understanding when I turned everything in, it would be looked at for review. This is what XXXX XXXX XXXX led me to believe.

I believe this account is being inaccurately maintained and reported due to a violation of my rights under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ), 20 U.S.C. 1232g, which protects the privacy of my educational records, including financial aid and loan information.

Specifically, I have reason to believe that my personally identifiable information ( PII ), including details related to this student loan, was improperly accessed, disclosed, or mishandled by, the U.S. Department of Education, or a third party such as the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ) without my consent or proper authorization, in violation of FERPA regulations ( 34 CFR Part 99 ). This unauthorized action undermines the integrity of my loan records and constitutes a breach of the privacy protections I am entitled to under federal law.

MY loan data has been compromised, rendering the current reporting of this account on my credit report inaccurate and the loan itself unenforceable. 
Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681i, you are required to investigate and correct inaccurate or unverifiable information reported to credit bureaus within 30 days. Furthermore, given the potential FERPA violation, I assert that this breach invalidates the enforceability of the debt, as my educational and financial records were not safeguarded as required by law. I therefore request the following actions : 1. Immediate deletion of this student loan account from my credit reports with XXXX, Experian, and XXXX. 
2. Full forgiveness of the outstanding balance of {$26000.00}, as the mishandling of my data constitutes a material breach of federal privacy standards.

3. Written confirmation of the investigation results and the actions taken to resolve this matter. 
If you determine that the information reported is accurate despite the FERPA violation, I request a detailed written explanation of your findings, including evidence of proper authorization for any data disclosures related to this loan. Please note that I am also submitting a complaint to the U.S. Department of Educations Family Policy Compliance Office to investigate this potential FERPA violation separately.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this serious matter. I expect a response within 30 days as required by law. Please direct all correspondence to me at the address listed above or via email at XXXX.

15026357,"Consumer Reporting Agencies play a crucial role in gathering and assessing consumer credit information. However, they must exercise their responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and respect for the consumers right to privacy. The banking system relies on accurate and fair credit reporting, and when these reporting methods are unfair, it undermines public trust, which is vital for the system 's stability. I never gave my explicit, written consent for these agencies to report my information, which is a violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ). This violation has led to an alleged case of identity theft, breaching 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. The accounts in question are not related to any transactions made by me.

The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act was created to ensure that laws and procedures are in place to protect consumers from abusive, deceptive, and unfair practices by debt collectors. In this case, the company has violated 15 U.S. Code 1692f, which prohibits debt collectors from using unfair or unconscionable means to collect a debt. Specifically, they can not collect any amounts that arent explicitly authorized by the agreement or allowed by law. Additionally, the company has violated 15 U.S. Code 1692e, which prohibits the use of false, deceptive, or misleading representations in debt collection efforts. This includes using deceptive methods to collect a debt or gather consumer information. Moreover, they are forbidden from contacting consumers at inconvenient times or places, or engaging in behavior that harasses or abuses consumers.

7034167,"Summary : US Bank mortgage paid funds out of my escrow to an insurance company I am not insured with. This overdrew my escrow. US Bank is not giving me my funds back and says I need to pursue the insurance company myself. The insurance company ( XXXX ) has not respond to my request for refund either. 

Detail : In XXXX I started shopping/getting quotes to possibly change both my auto and homeowners insurance. I received a quote from XXXX insurance, but after they sent me the policy documents for my signature, I saw that the policy showed the wrong effective date, and had some other false information that needed to be corrected. So I emailed XXXX with a list of changes needed and asked for new quotes. Later that night I logged into my mortgage servicer 's website ( US Bank ) and noticed that they paid a payment out of my escrow, equal to the amount of the quote I received from Farmers a few days earlier. This payment had overdrawn my escrow by almost {$1500.00}. 

I spoke with Farmers on XX/XX/XXXX, and told them that those funds needed to be returned to my mortgage account at US Bank, since I had not yet finalized the policy change. ( I had not received the new quote, I had not signed anything at all with XXXX, and even if I were to go through with the change, the effective date was to be more than nine weeks in the future, so they had no standing to bill my mortgage. ) I was told they would contact me the next day, but they did not. 

So on XX/XX/XXXX I called my mortgage servicer to request that they obtain a refund from XXXX. I was transferred around to multiple different departments, who all told me that because XXXX had my account number ( which I had provided to them in anticipation of finalizing the new insurance - before I received the error-filled policy documents ), that they had no further responsibility to verify the validity of the payment request before sending Farmer the payment from my escrow account. Apparently it is not their policy to verify that billings they receive from insurance companys are valid. As long as the insurance company has an account number, then they do not ensure that a policy has been agreed upon/signed. In a day and age where rampant hacking leads to constant fraud, they take no steps to protect their customer or do any due diligence before sending out a customer 's funds. The last person I spoke with at US Bank hung up on me. 

So I want to formally complain about US Bank. US Bank did not due their due diligence in protecting my funds. They did not ensure that the invoice from XXXX was legitimate, before paying it. And they will not return my funds to me. At this point I've made two additional attempts to contact Farmers, but they have not responded either, however I believe that US Bank 's failure to properly vet on a payment request from an insurer not previously associated with my account resulted in this loss and it should be US Bank that corrects it.",Mortgage,Trouble during payment process,5

I believe this information is inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable, and I request a thorough reinvestigation in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), including Sections 607 ( b ), 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( 6 ), and other applicable laws. 

My dispute is based on the following concerns, which are consistent with findings identified in the CFPB Consent Order ( File No. 2025-CFPB-0002 ) : 1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Reinvestigation : My previous dispute was not properly investigated. I provided relevant documentation, but Equifax appears to have relied solely on the furnishers response without considering this evidencecontrary to the FCRAs requirements under 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) and ( 4 ).

2. Failure to Transmit All Relevant Information : I have reason to believe that Equifax did not send all relevant consumer-provided documentation to the furnisher, violating 611 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA.

3. Deficient Results Letter : The reinvestigation results I received were vague, contradictory, and confusingcontaining conflicting statements and lacking a clear explanation of what was corrected, if anything. This violates 611 ( a ) ( 6 ).

4. Potential Reinsertion of Deleted Information : If this disputed item was previously removed and has since reappeared, I demand documentation proving that Equifax complied with 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ), including certification from the furnisher and timely notice to me.

5. Unfair and Deficient Dispute Process : As documented in the CFPB Order, Equifax has admitted to flawed systems, unreasonably restrictive document acceptance policies, and repeated failures to address consumer disputes appropriately. I demand that my dispute be handled in compliance with the affirmative requirements set forth in the Consent Order. 

Please find attached copies of supporting documents relevant to this dispute [ list documents here, e.g., billing statements, identity verification, creditor correspondence, etc. ]. 

I request the following : A thorough reinvestigation of the disputed item ( s ). 
A clear and complete explanation of the outcome of the reinvestigation.

Immediate correction or deletion of any inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information.

A free updated copy of my credit report reflecting any corrections made.

My payment amount was {$1400.00}. On XX/XX/2022 I called NewRez and spoke with a male representative. I recorded the phone call and it lasted about XXXX minutes. During this conversation the representative explained to me that my payments I made in the amount of {$1400.00} were applied to principal and not to my due date amount. The representative said this was because of an escrow difference and "" their system '' applies it towards principal and then considers the customer late for the amount due payment. I received a {$50.00} late fee charge.

I expressed my concern that NewRez would not notify me sooner than XX/XX/XXXX of the late payment. NewRez stated they attempted to call me at a "" work '' number and was unable to reach me. Despite putting my cellphone number on my original loan application, somehow NewRez determined that they should call an automated work number without dialing the proper extension or trying to get a hold of a switchboard operator to reach me. I filed a complaint with the company regarding their lack of attention to this matter. The representative took my complaint, and assured me that he would apply my payments towards my total due amount and reverse the late fee. 

I continued to check my account waiting for the changes to take place. On XX/XX/2022, I saw that the changes to my account were never applied. Additionally, a second late fee of {$50.00} was applied. I called a second representative, escalated my complaint to a supervisor. The supervisor assured me that the changes would be made. I stated my position that NewREz/Shellpoint is purposely deceiving customers when they accept our money, apply it to principal, then charge us a late fee for a past due payment. I'm concerned about the ethical implications this presents on NewRez. If this can happen to me, it is probably happening to hundreds, or thousands of other customers and NewRez is benefiting from the late payments of thousands of their "" customers ''.

The property that kept was finance with XXXX XXXX XXXX at the time and the one that she kept was finance with XXXX XXXX. 
We were upside down in the mortgage for the property that I kept and therefore refinancing was not an option ( we could n't afford to pay and make up the difference ). But XXXX XXXX XXXX offered a XXXX XXXX XXXX program that they said I could use to assume the loan and remove her from it. I started that process immediately and filed all of the paperwork and request, etc ... When they processed it they said that they could n't approve it at that time because my name was still on the other mortgage with XXXX XXXX ( my ex-wife refused to complete her required refinance to have my name removed ). The only other option was for me to prove to XXXX XXXX XXXX that I had been making the payments by myself for at least 12 months. About 11 months later she ended up selling the other property which got my name off of it. So I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX and started the process again. But then in the course of it they changed the servicing of my loan over the Seterus. So I started again with Seterus. But Seterus does n't offer a Qualified Loan Assumption program like XXXX XXXX XXXX does. But they told me that I could do a Loan Modification and change the terms, reduce my monthly payment, and remove her name. So I went through that process with them and made those changes. And they only required my signature to do so ( not hers ) and her name was removed from everything associate with my account with them. And I checked and double checked this with them several times to make sure. This was completed XX/XX/XXXX. 
In XX/XX/XXXX I was served with a petition from my ex-wife claiming that she was still on my mortgage. So I called and checked with Seterus again. And again they told me that she was no longer on my mortgage or the account, etc ... But when I asked if she was still considered to be an obligor on the account they said that yes, she it still considered to be an obligor on the original loan. So it still shows up on her credit report and if I defaulted on the loan then they would approach her about it. I have talked with Seterus numerous times to try to find some way to resolve this. Unfortunately my credit score is not good right now and I do n't qualify to refinance it. And Seterus is n't actually a lendor so they ca n't refinance it anyway. I thought that I had done the right thing over a year ago. And if my ex-wife had cooperated XX/XX/XXXX then I would have completed the Qualified Loan Assumption with XXXX XXXX XXXX and this would n't be an issue. I had not idea that that was a XXXX XXXX XXXX program only. And again, when I explained the situation to Seterus and what I needed to do they directed me to the Loan Modification and told me that my ex-wife 's name was removed from my account.

So as you can see, not only are their discrepancies in dates, but it is obvious these are the exact same accounts just resold to another debt collector, despite the fact both accounts were already deleted and removed from all my credit reports. 

I was never provided notification, or allowed to contest this information. Once a debt comes off of your credit report, no furnisher, creditor, debt collector or credit bureau is legally allowed to reinsert it, disguise it and re-report it, without notifying you and giving you the opportunity to contest it. Is this not correct? 

I am in the middle of being approved for a mortgage and this is an absolute joke that the bureaus even allowed this information to slip past and be re-reported. Quite honestly I could pursue legal avenues and not only get my credit report cleansed of the false information, but I am also likely entitled to monetary damages.

My home is located in a government declared disaster area due to lava eruption in Hawaii. 
Through multiple phone calls in discussions with US bank home mortgage representatives I have been informed that my mortgage is in "" forbearance '' status. I was informed by US Bank representatives that for a period of 90 days US bank would NOT report anything to the credit bureaus and all late fees would be waived. You are clearly aware of this forbearance situation as you quoted reference to my Relationship Manager in the letter. 
In this letter dated XXXX of XX/XX/2018 you state that you "" may report information about this account to credit bureaus ''. This is in direct contradiction to everything I have been told by US bank home mortgage representatives. You further state that "" failure to remit payment by the late charge date will result in a late fee assessment ''. This is also in complete contradiction to what I have been told by multiple US bank mortgage representatives and my relationship manager, XXXX XXXX. 
Do verify immediately, in writing, that my account is in forbearance status as quoted to me by multiple representatives and my Relationship Manager. Also verify in writing that you will not make reports to the credit bureaus and late charges will not be charged as stated during the forbearance period of 90 days. 
Understandably, during this disaster situation there are significant issues to be dealt with daily. The last thing we as mortgagees need is for the bank to send false and inaccurate information in direct contradiction to what we have been quoted on the phone. 
Do verify, in writing, the status of my account and the specifics of the forbearance process including reporting to credit agencies. 
I highly recommended that US Bank coordinate mailings and statements to clearly indicate the forbearance status of the account. Letters such as XXXX XX/XX/2018 letters should be sent by a mortgagee 's Relationship Manager with accurate and current information. 
Also, in conversation with US Bank customer service representative XXXX on XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX HST, recorded, XXXX stated that she would discontinue my automatic monthly payment drafts from my credit union.

After those three months were completed, they mailed me a modification letter that I had only a couple of days to read, understand, sign and return.

We completed all we needed to refinance the house, but when the loan officer requested our payment history from the current mortgage company, it showed we were 3 months behind in our payments, which I knew nothing of. It took two phone calls for me to find out what was happening and I ask them to fix the situation so I could refinance, but they refused.

I was simply doing as I was instructed my the loan company regarding the modification, which I thought would help us and the company managed to drag this situation out for months. Now we are stuck. We can not accept the loan modification, we can not refinance, we can not afford to pay the 8.9 fixed interest rate and fees on our loan. We have a nice home with excellent equity and need to refinance to pay our debts and lower our rates. All we need is our payment history modified so that we can obtain the loan.

6768457,"After the first complaint I filed, was told to bad Wells Fargos records of our account show that no XXXX  XXXX payments were made. 
I have been able to prove they had been made. Not denying it just sorry but its not enough. Ok, Im dealing with and talking about a company that has been sued and fined 20+ times. Now the Cfpb sends all complaints about Wells Fargo to Wells Fargo! Ive been able to prove the XXXX  XXXX payments, sorry but again there records prove different, Oh they say they only go back 7 years. So Wells Fargo can only go back 7 years and XXXX XXXX only to XXXX. This all changed when XXXX XXXX saw the bubble burst coming and began insulating themselves from any lawsuits in the future, by claiming they were never aware and if they were they were not willing and knowingly involved with Wells Fargo and EZ payments through XXXX XXXX. 
I have said since I filed the original complaint. I know we made the payments and we were not behind. I have said since the beginning, I took my receipts from XXXX XXXX, and I was told that I would have a number wrong or switched. I have those actual wires and on them you can see, the 4 that wasnt wrong, thats what I was being told repeatedly! It started in XXXX when we first bought the house. Its still continuing to this day. 
I didnt send all the papers for Wells Fargo to inform me that we had been late or not making payments. When Im fact we were and had made our payments. The blatant strealing started basically as soon as we signed the contract with Wells Fargo. As you can see we made payments from our bank account that shows up months after the actual date of payments. We were making our regular house payment and literally bring bombarded with final notification, the mortgage statement sending payments to XXXX MD, rhe final notice from North Carolina,! the amount of bills and statements. The XXXX XXXX receipts that started in XXXX showing proof of payments to be told I was off a number. I filed complaints with Wells Fargo as early as XXXX, not knowing that XXXX XXXX and Wells Fargo were just blatantly stealing everything. In XXXX XXXX. I. One month of payments between XXXX XXXX and bank payments! 
We payed and payed. I have never changed what I have said regarding Wells Fargo and their out right criminal actions and activities for so long. Now with the help of the Cfpb, Wells Fargo, XXXX  XXXX, still are robbing consumers. I have proven time and time that all my statements have been true. 
We are asking for XXXX XXXX dollars now since its the 3rd time filing a complaint to be told that oh well you dont have any proof. This proves no matter how or when or what payment process we made, Wells Fargo has continued to refuse to compensate us for now the 22 + years, never denying what Im claiming, because what I have claimed has been true. 
So knowing this and knowing we were and had always been making our house payments, on top of the years and years of double triple billing claiming we never made the payments. 
So we would have never should have been to a loan modification let alone one that raised the principal and extended the payments for another 30 years. The forced bankruptcy, add the health damage to my wife. Knowing she made everyone of the payments only to be told we were past due. In one month XXXX. In XXXX. The mortgage statements are not even right, XXXX shows we never had a loan modification. 
I want XXXX XXXX for the fact I have proven with our first 3 complaints. 
Wells Fargo is still allowed to run a criminal enterprise along with XXXX XXXX and the Cfpb. This is why no consumer can get any type of restitution from years and thousands and thousands of dollars stolen. Stolen by our mortgage company and the payment services they insisted we use due to the easiness they together made for us. 
Now Im retired with limited funds my wife is now XXXX, mainly due to the stress of dealing with Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX, which in turn caused a XXXX XXXX to take over again due to and still the stress of all this. When I should just get a call as to were to wire our money.

Despite my best efforts, I have been unable to resolve this matter directly with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

I discovered an outstanding balance on a vehicle loan for which I was a co-signer. Unfortunately, the primary account holders, my parents, are deceased, and I was unaware of the remaining balance on the loan. Upon learning of this obligation, I reached out to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. I was told by them that the account was sold to Radius Global Solutions. I immediately contacted Radius Global Solution to arrange a payment plan, as I am committed to fulfilling any financial responsibilities associated with the loan. Radius Global Solutions told me that any positive payments towards the account would not be reported since they are a non-reporting agency. I was told by them I would need to call XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX back to see what they can do to ensure that if I make a payment, it would be reported as a positive payment on my credit report. 

I then contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to see if there was anyway for them to report any positive payments. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX informed me that they would not report any positive payments until the full {$26000.00} is paid in full. They have explicitly stated that the account will not be removed from collections until the entire balance of {$26000.00} is paid in full. This inflexible stance is profoundly concerning and leaves me with limited options for resolution. There is no positive resolution for me to pay the amount when there is no reporting of payments. This account is scheduled to leave my credit report in XX/XX/XXXX. There is no incentive for me to pay the amount since it will not be reported at all as a positive payment. 

Furthermore, it is unjust that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is unwilling to allow positive payments to be applied to the account. As a co-signer, I am eager to rectify this matter and demonstrate my willingness to fulfill my financial obligations. However, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 's current approach only prolongs the negative impact on my credit history without providing a viable path toward resolution. This is greatly unfair to a consumer like myself. They expect me to literally "" throw away '' money towards this account, and not one positive payment would be noted. I am not in a position to pay the full amount. 

Given the circumstances surrounding this account, including my lack of awareness of the outstanding balance and my earnest efforts to address the issue, I respectfully and urgently request that the repossession charge-off be promptly and permanently removed from all major credit reporting agencies, including XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. This removal is crucial for me to move forward with my financial endeavors and rebuild my creditworthiness, as I plan to attend graduate school and purchase a home. 

I appreciate your attention to this matter and request that you conduct a thorough investigation into the actions of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Radius Global Solutions. A fair and equitable resolution can be reached with your intervention. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this dispute.

Over a period of years, my wife and I have acquired a few properties, namely our XXXX home which we decided to rent out, our primary residence and an investment property (XXXXplex) in XXXX and our home in XXXX.  The mortgage to these properties were financed through XXXX Mortgage.  At some point in time, theses were acquired by PNC Bank.  At the time of the economic downturn, I reached out to the banks to attempt either refinancing or modification of the loans.  My credit rating at the time was XXXX plus.  I was informed that in order to qualify I would have to be delinquent and that refinancing was not an option because I had more than XXXX mortgages.  We began the modification process and after a year of repeatedly sending and resending documents somehow I received a modification agreement on XXXX property.  By the XXXX month of trial period just before the modification would have begun, PNC abruptly closed the account.  They stated we had broken the agreement, which was blatantly false and would not offer an explanation or discussion on the matter.  The property was immediately sold at auction.  Thankfully we kept a paper trail in anticipation of being defrauded in this process.  We hired attorneys to help us navigate through the short sale process on our original primary residence.  PNC  delayed the short sale process for over XXXX months with a qualified buyer waiting.  This home was also foreclosed on, so now we are down to one last trial and tribulation with PNC.  Even with a team of attorneys we have been unable to complete the modification process for over XXXX years.  I attempted the process alone for 18 months without legal representation.  So for close to 4 years we have been in limbo with respect to our primary residence.   Imagine our surprise or lack of surprise when we received a $XXXX settlement from the XXXX for discriminatory practices.  These last XXXX years have been hell on my wife and me.  After reading our situation we hope you can help us get this settled, for you are our last hope.  Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope to hear from you soon.",Mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",5

I recently discovered that LVNV FUNDING LLC, in conjunction with XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX, has initiated garnishment proceedings against my wages for an alleged debt that does not belong to me. The account in question, with the account number XXXX, was opened on XX/XX/XXXX, without my knowledge or consent. 

Despite my repeated attempts to dispute the validity of this debt in the past, LVNV FUNDING LLC and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. have continued to pursue collection efforts and have now resorted to garnishing my wages. It is worth noting that the reported amount of the debt is {$1000.00}, yet the garnishment sum taken from my paycheck is {$1000.00}, which further adds to the unfairness of this situation. 

I believe that LVNV FUNDING LLC and XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX. have violated my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and other relevant consumer protection laws by engaging in these unfair and deceptive practices. Specifically, their actions constitute : Failure to provide adequate verification of the debt despite previous disputes. 
Garnishing wages for a debt that has not been verified or proven to be valid. 
Falsely reporting the debt amount, leading to an incorrect garnishment sum. 

I am seeking your assistance in resolving this matter and ensuring that my rights are protected. I request that LVNV FUNDING LLC and XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX. cease all collection activities immediately and release the garnishment on my wages until the validity of the debt is properly verified. 

Furthermore, I urge the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to investigate this matter thoroughly and take appropriate action against LVNV FUNDING LLC and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. for their unfair and unlawful practicesXXXX XXXX XXXX Enclosed with this letter are copies of relevant documents, including previous dispute communications and evidence of the garnishment proceedings. I have recorded conversations with the agencies where inaccurate information was claimed to have been provided, and I am willing to provide the audio recordings if necessary.

My husband XXXX & I live in XXXX, but have a home in XXXX XXXX, Florida on which First Horizon holds a mortgage. 
XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - our home was struck by XXXX XXXX, causing extensive damage resulting in the necessity of a completely new roof and other structural repairs. 
XXXX XXXX- we flew over to Florida to assess the situation. 

XXXX XXXX- entered a claim with our Insurers XXXX - Claim # XXXX XXXX XXXX - Loss Assessor assessed extent of damage and confirmed scope of repairs needed. 
We flew back to XXXX. 
Interim cheque from XXXX for {$9100.00} issued. 
XXXX XXXX interim cheque received in XXXX and sent to First Horizon ( FH ) for endorsement. 
XXXX XXXX cheque received and signed for at FH. 
XXXX XXXX email sent to FH asking for an update. 
XXXX XXXX reply from FH stating cheque would be sent out that day and asking for a copy of XXXX Assessors report. I telephoned FH to check where cheque would be sent. 
See attached invoice from XXXX XXXX for the phone call. 

XXXX XXXX - Copy report emailed to FH Loss Draft Dept. 
XXXX XXXX email from FH Loss Draft Dept confirming receipt. 
XXXX XXXX emailed FH chasing cheque see attached. 

XXXX XXXXr FH finally responded saying that for security and privacy they could not provide any information and suggested that I ring. 
We had to use our personal savings to transfer money to USA to pay the roofing Company. 
XXXX XXXX email FH saying that I wanted someone to ring me as it was over XXXX weeks since I was supposedly sent my cheque. 
XXXX XXXX I received XXXX x letters from FH both dated XXXX XXXX but post marked XXXX XXXX arriving over XXXX weeks later than posted and over XXXX weeks later than created. 
Why such a deplorable delay? 
Ironically XXXX of the letters states, We hope to assist you with repairing the property as quickly as possible Some hope!

Out of sheer frustration I rang FH and spoke at length to the Loss Draft dept who told me that our cheque had been returned to them on XXXX XXXX as undeliverable. They had apparently left a message on our telephone number in Florida despite knowing that we lived in XXXX and that is where the cheque was supposed to be going. 
If I had not rung it would still be there! I was rightly, as you will agree, beyond angry!

FH clearly failed to provide a satisfactory standard of service.

I asked that the cheque be sent out again and ensured that they had the correct XXXX address. I was then transferred to a Customer Service Supervisor, XXXX, who apologised for the ongoing debacle, assured me that the cheque would be sent out as a matter of urgency. She also suggested that I write in with my formal complaint. I told her that I was expecting further cheques from Insurers and did not want the same thing to happen again. 
I was on the phone for over an hour! See attached invoice from XXXX XXXX for the phone call. 

XXXX XXXX yet another email to FH enquiring about the whereabouts of the cheque which was supposed to have been sent out by FH as a matter of urgency and still not received XXXX weeks later. 

XXXX XXXX having had no reply to my email of XXXX, I emailed FH to make further complaint that I had been waiting for this cheque for 3 MONTHS and to ask about their Complaints Procedure. 

XXXX XXXX email to FH requesting the courtesy of a response. 

Deafening Silence! 

XXXX XXXX cheque finally arrived attached to a letter from FH dated XXXX XX/XX/XXXX but because it had not been presented ASI put a stop on it on XXXX XXXX and reissued it. 

I am still awaiting the replacement cheque and so this will have to happen all over again with cheques bouncing back & forth over the XXXX! 

It is now XXXX weeks since our home was damaged and we are no further forward and it is down to the ineptitude and prevarication of FH.

All this time FH has been able to send us several Mortgage Statements and notices of Interest Rate change stating that my mortgage is going up by {$200.00} or so, so why has it not been able to do a simple task of endorsing and returning XXXX cheque? 



I am so genuinely very XXXX XXXX and obviously distressed at, not only the mental, but the financial burden that all of this has placed upon myself and my husband through no fault of our own. 

Not only have we suffered the damage to our house we have been made to suffer further by FHs failure to operate in a professional or efficient manner and to deal with the matter in a timely manner. 

As an ex XXXX XXXX in Her Majestys government, I am appalled at the laisez-faire attitude of FH I am seeking an offer of recompense from FH for all the time ( XXXX hours and counting ), costs and angst that we have had to bear due to the direct failure of FH to provide a level of service that one could reasonably have expected it to provide. Also, some clear assurance that it will improve.

10093889,"I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding the negligence of my mortgage company in handling our mortgage payments, as well as their inadequate customer service. Their failure to properly process payments and the difficulty in reaching representatives has caused significant financial hardship and frustration. 

Our original monthly payment is {$1700.00}. Our first payment to Mr. Cooper was made in XXXX but was returned on XX/XX/XXXX, incurring a returned check fee of {$29.00}. The payment was then taken out on XX/XX/XXXX, but we were charged another returned check fee on XX/XX/XXXX, and again on XX/XX/XXXX. 

In XXXX, we made a payment arrangement for XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/year>, with XXXX payment set at {$2500.00}. However, the payments for both XXXX and XXXX were not processed properly. We were charged returned check fees of {$29.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. This led us to contact the VA to see what other options were available to make payments, and under their guidance, we were informed that we could pay via XXXX Mr. Cooper failed to inform us about, despite numerous inquiries. XXXX payment was successfully made via XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Later in XXXX, we received a call from the company informing us that the payment arrangement set up by the previous representative was no longer valid. The new arrangement extends until XX/XX/year>, with a payment amount of {$2300.00}. Furthermore, we were told that we could no longer use XXXX and must make payments via autopay, the very system that caused these issues in the first place. So we opted to pay XXXX payment the original amount of {$1700.00} until some kind of resolution can be made. 

Now, we are paying over {$1000.00} in loan interest, with only {$200.00} going toward the principal. We are also being charged return check fees of {$29.00}, 2-3 times a month due to their mishandling of the autopay system. The company has been inconsistent in handling payment agreements and providing clear information on payment options. 

Additionally, speaking to a representative has become an ordeal. Each time we need to speak to someone about our mortgage, we have to spend 20 minutes or more navigating through an automated system just to be routed to a representative. This experience tells me that customer satisfaction is not even a priority for this company. They do not seem concerned with their customers well-being, which mirrors the very same issues that led to Nationstar being bought out by Mr. Cooper. The problems continue, just under a new name. 

It is deeply concerning that this company is still allowed to handle peoples mortgages, homes, and sense of security. We have already spoken to the VA, who informed us that payments can be made via XXXX, despite the mortgage company failing to provide this option after multiple inquiries. They also falsely claimed that debit card payments can be made through their automatic payment line, which is not true. 

This company has repeatedly failed to uphold their end of our agreement, and their removal of other payment options has made it increasingly difficult for us to manage payments. Their negligence has caused us financial hardship and undue stress. 

I request immediate action to resolve this issue, including reinstating other payment methods, addressing the fees caused by their mishandling, and improving customer service for the benefit of all their clients.",Mortgage,Trouble during payment process,3

Than I called again and they said it was fixed and would start drafting on XX/XX/2020. Today XX/XX/XXXX I received a phone call stating they can not fix the problem and the dates to be drafted will continue to be the opposite weeks I get paid.

We are XXXX in our XXXX. Our major source of income was lost almost three years ago. We have struggled to meet our financial obligations since then. We modified our loan with XXXX two to three years ago and after that, they sold us to Green Tree LLC. I started a low paying XXXX {$9.00} per hour XXXX XXXX job to try to stay afloat. With my husbands medical needs, car payment, and a second mortgage payment ( which we re-negotiated to a low monthly amount ), and living expenses, we kept falling behind. Green Tree LLC initially sounded sympathetic and sent us credit counseling and modification information-which we had already completed, but slowly began to contact us by phone over and over, demanding payment and asking if we had jewelry to sell, and asking why we were so "" lazy '' not to get a better paying job, along with threats of foreclosure and sheriffs sale. These calls would start early in the morning and last until XXXX in the evening. When I told Green Tree LLC that we had listed our home for sale, and would pay them off when it sold, their response was insistent that we give the name of our Realtor so they could discuss a short sale with our Realtor, of which I refused to give the information. Our home is located on almost XXXX acres in the country, on a small lake. We have a pole barn and shop building, and a nice home/four bedrooms/two baths. As you can see by Exhibit # 1 XXXX Statement of XXXX XXXX XXXX our home has enough value to sell and make nice profit. As I understand it, the tax value placed on a home from XXXX XXXX is typically lower than what the home would sell for on the market. Unfortunately, the offers we got were not what we needed to pay off the existing debt. At this point, Green Tree LLC demanded we take whatever offer we could get, as they knew they would be repaid first. The staff I spoke with kept harassing me about being a dead-beat. I have never in all my life been a dead-beat. The intense mental pressure eventually led me to sell the home for a much lower price than we could have gotten, just to stop the calls and pressure. See Exhibit # 2 ( Purchase Price information ) When our buyer called Green Tree LLC to get the current payoff, the employee we spoke with was unable to tell us the balance due! Then, the employee spoke with our buyer about assuming our mortgage and assured him that he could do so through Green Tree LLC. Our buyer remarked that with his knowledge of Green Tree LLC, he would have no desire to be involved with this Company.

7399054,"Fay Servicing LLC has illegally opened an escrow account without my written consent and was informed from the XXXX County Tax Claim Bureau that I was in a payment plan. Instead of Fay Servicing LLC allowing me to reimburse them for the taxes they paid on my behalf without my consent they establish an illegal escrow account. 

Fay Serving LLC stated that there records indicate that you then reached out to Fay on XX/XX/XXXX by phone to advise that you have an agreement with the county and your tax payments are made apart of a repayment plan. However, Fay did not receive any documentation or notice in writing of the repayment plan with the county to update our records. As such, on XX/XX/XXXX Fay sent another letter to your mailing address advising of the delinquency amount. The letter does also indicate that if the taxes owed were not paid withing thirty ( 30 ) days of the date of the notice, Fay would pay all delinquent tax amounts owed including penalties. The letter also indicates that the loan would then be converted to an escrowed loan in which the monthly payment would increase. 

Please be advised that on XX/XX/XXXX, I exercised my right to pay my XXXX taxes in an agreed payment plan with the XXXX County Tax Claim Bureau. ( Please reference Exhibit A - payment plan agreement provided to me by the XXXX County Tax Claim Bureau. ) I was in a payment plan agreement prior to Fay Servicing LLC, generated letter on XX/XX/XXXX. Therefore, my XXXX taxes were being paid as agreed. ) Fay Servicing LLC claimed "" However, on XX/XX/XXXX our records indicated that the delinquent taxes were not paid nor was Fay notified from the county of the payment plan for your tax payments. '' Please be advised that prior to XX/XX/XXXX, I had paid the following installment payments towards my {$3200.00} XXXX tax bill. Therefore, Fay Servicing LLC records on XX/XX/XXXX is inaccurate. ) ( Please reference Exhibit A payment plan agreement from the XXXX  County Tax Claim Bureau ). XX/XX/XXXX, I paid {$1500.00} as my first installment payment, on XX/XX/XXXX I paid {$650.00} as my second installment payment, and on XX/XX/XXXX I paid {$680.00} as my 3rd installment payment. On XX/XX/XXXX I went to pay my final payment of {$530.00} and was informed by Bill from the tax claim bureau that my final payment was paid by Fay Servicing LLC. 

Fay Servicing LLC claimed "" Our records further reflect that on XX/XX/XXXX you reached out to Fay to advise that you were about to pay the tax amount of {$530.00} to XXXX County, however the tax office informed you that Fay had already made the payment. You also advised that you would be placing the {$530.00} back into the escrow and request with the tax office to submit a refund back to Fay for the amounts that were paid and then request for the escrow to be removed. However, no refund was received from the tax collectors. '' Please be advised that on XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Fay Servicing LLC and a representative by the name of XXXX XXXX answered the call. I explained to XXXX that I was currently in a payment plan with the XXXX County Tax Claim Bureau for my XXXX taxes and that I was in the process of making my final payment however, I was informed by XXXX from the XXXX County Tax Claim Bureau that Fay Servicing LLC had paid {$530.00} as my final payment for my XXXX tax bill. ) XXXX apologized to me and stated Fay Servicing LLC was not aware that I was in a payment plan and asked if the XXXX County Tax Claim Bureau would be willing to reimburse Fay Servicing LLC for the taxes it paid. I told XXXX I could not answer that question on behalf of XXXX County Tax Claim Bureau I suggested that I call XXXX County Tax Claim Bureau and establish a 3 way conference call that way XXXX can speak with the representative at the tax claim bureau and ask her questions. 

The conference call was successful and XXXX, myself, and XXXX XXXX county tax claim bureau representative was all on the call ). XXXX asked XXXX if it was true that XXXX XXXX was in a payment plan agreement with the XXXX County Tax Claim Bureau for my XXXX taxes and if the XXXX County Tax Claim Bureau would be able to reimburse Fay Servicing LLC for the {$530.00} payment Fay Servicing LLC paid for my XXXX tax bill and the {$3400.00} Fay Servicing LLC paid for my XXXX tax bill. I asked XXXX if she can confirm if I was current or delinquent for my XXXX taxes. ( Exhibit XXXX ) is proof I was not not delinquent for my XXXX taxes. XXXX informed XXXX that the XXXX County Tax Claim Bureau will not be able to reimburse Fay Servicing LLC for the XXXX tax amount paid of {$530.00} nor the {$3.00}, XXXX amount Fay Servicing LLC paid for my XXXX tax bill. I then agreed to reimburse Fay Servicing for these 2 amounts. 

XXXX then asked XXXX if she can send her in an email my payment plan agreement. ( Please see Exhibit XXXX email from XXXX ). Once Fay Servicing LLC received proof from the county tax claim bureau that I was in a payment plan for my XXXX taxes they should of allowed me to reimburse them the {$530.00} for my XXXX tax payment. 

The fact that Fay Servicing LLC only paid {$530.00} towards my {$3200.00} XXXX tax bill should have alerted Fay Servicing LLC to do more verification. Clearly, they would have discovered that I had paid 95 % of my XXXX tax bill. Once Fay Servicing LLC, received proof from the county tax claim bureau that I was not delinquent for my XXXX taxes- they should not have paid them. And since they did pay them without me being delinquent and then put my taxes in escrow without my written consent is illegal and a violation of my rights. 

Fay Servicing LLC claimed that "" Fay then advised you by phone on XX/XX/XXXX that Fay paid the remaining XXXX tax balance in the total of {$5300.00} - ( Please be advised that this amount is a typo- {$530.00} should be the amount stated. ) and the taxes for XXXX in the amount of {$3400.00} and that anytime there is interest placed on the taxes it is considered delinquent. ( Exhibit XXXX proves my XXXX taxes were not delinquent. ) Fay Servicing LLC claimed "" However, on XX/XX/XXXX Fay placed a request to verify if there was any over payment for the property taxes and you indicated that you have the option to pay the taxes in three ( 3 ) installments and we received a copy of the money order you sent for {$780.00}. It was at this time we confirmed that the tax bill reflects three ( 3 ) installments, however we have not received a copy of a repayment plan. 

Please be advised on XX/XX/XXXX, I received my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX bill in the mail. ( see Exhibit B and Exhibit C. ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I mailed a payment in the amount of {$780.00} as my Installment # 1 payment. ( see Exhibit D ). Exhibit C allows 3 installment payments to be made. Prior to me making my installment # 1 payment I called Fay Servicing LLC to inform them that I received my XXXX real estate tax bill and that I was taking advantage of the option to pay my XXXX real estate tax bill using the installment option. On XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Fay Servicing LLC paid my entire XXXX real estate tax bill in the amount of {$2300.00} without my written consent. I am not delinquent for my XXXX real estate taxes. 

Fay Servicing LLC, claimed "" We further followed up then with XXXX XXXX XXXX if the payment of {$780.00} was received by you as Fay paid the full year for XXXX at the discounted rate of {$2300.00} and it was advised that the payment of {$780.00} had not yet been received. However, Fay opened a work order on our end to track any possible refunds. '' Please be advised that I was informed by XXXX the tax collector that all installment # 1 payments will not show posted until the end of XXXX beginning of XXXX ( See Exhibit D as my payment ). 

Fay Servicing LLC claimed that "" Please note that Fay is unable to investigate the removal of the escrow account until the escrow balance is brought back positive. As of the date of this letter, the escrow balance reflects a negative {$4600.00}. We apologize for the inconvenience this has caused. However the escrow was not added to the loan illegally as per the terms of your mortgage and note Fay is able to pay any delinquent taxes on behalf of the account to protect our interest in the loan. Upon the escrow being brought to a positive balance, we ask that you please submit a request in writing asking for the escrow to be removed at that time. 

Please be advised that I have provided all factual evidence from Exhibit XXXX through D that Fay Servicing LLC has illegally opened up an escrow violating my rights. Fay Servicing LLC has stated that they were not aware that I was paying my XXXX tax bill via a payment plan. Exhibit XXXX confirms that XXXX from the tax claim bureau sent XXXX the Fay Servicing Representative an attached copy of my payment plan agreement. 

My XXXX tax bill was {$3200.00} which I paid 95 % of this amount in my established payment plan provided by the XXXX County Tax Claim Bureau. Considering Fay Servicing LLC only had to pay {$530.00} toward this entire bill should have alerted Fay Servicing LLC to do a more thorough investigation with XXXX County Tax Claim Bureau which would have provided them with my payment plan they initiated showing I was making my payments as agreed according to their payment plan. 

Fay Servicing LLC claims that I was delinquent for my XXXX taxes - Exhibit XXXX email from the tax claim bureau representative states that I was current for my XXXX taxes. 

Fay Servicing LLC states that it paid my entire XXXX real estate taxes because my installment payment has not yet been confirmed. - Exhibit D- shows my payment receipt of my installment 1 payment. 

Fay Servicing LLC is violating my rights and has place my taxes in an illegal escrow. I did not give written consent for Fay Servicing LLC to escrow my taxes therefore I want my taxes out of Fay Servicing LLC illegal escrow account. My mortgage payment went from {$630.00} to {$1400.00}, to {$1100.00} now to {$1100.00}. This is illegal. 

My evidence conclude I was in an established payment plan by the XXXX County Tax Claim Bureau which is my right for my XXXX taxes ( See Exhibit A ). I was not delinquent for my XXXX taxes ( See Exhibit XXXX ) nor am I delinquent for my XXXX taxes ( See Exhibit C ). I want this illegal escrow removed. I have rights.

Then on XX/XX/XXXX I received another email saying they received the payment of {$500.00} but it was less the amount of the {$2500.00} and it was being held as a partial payment until the remaining balance is paid. I then tried to make the payment again and the system still wouldnt allow me to do so. On XX/XX/XXXX in which is my payday and they know this, I received an email that my credit score has been effected so again I tried to login and make the payment but yet again the system wouldnt allow me to due so. I then decided to call them and see what was going on and as always they said its just how the system is set up and now not only was it reported that I was one month behind but two when the payment in XXXX I had until XX/XX/XXXX to pay it. I then made a payment for {$1500.00} and its still showing Im a month behind. XXXX the representative I spoke to stated that they dont allow partial payments but Ive always made partial payments due to I only get paid every two weeks. Every since I signed up with Quicken Loans/Rocket Mortgage my life has been a living XXXX. From day one all I heard was lies. When closing on the house on XX/XX/XXXX I was told that in the state of Maryland I would have to put the co-signer name on the deed of the house due to the law but months later I talked with a lawyer and found out that this was false. Maryland law states that you can have a person name on the loan and not the deed. This alone has put me in a very bad situation due to the other person on the mortgage now can live for free as long as she doesnt care about her credit being affected and all the payments would fall on me in order to keep a good credit score. Ive been through this with Quicken Loans/Rocket Mortgage every since closing and has gotten nowhere, they just say the only way to get her name off the deed is to take her to court when if the representative would not have made the false statement from XXXXay one I would not be in the situation Im in now because me and the co-signer had already agreed to her name not being on the deed. Now I cant sell or anything without her agreeing and if the payments are not made my credit score is effected every time and yet still she gets to live for free.",Mortgage,Trouble during payment process,1

For example, disputes relating to the type of account, principal balance, scheduled payment amount on an account, or the amount of the credit limit on an open-end account ; the consumer 's performance or other conduct concerning an account or other relationship with you. For example, disputes relating to the current payment status, high balance, date a payment was made, amount of a payment made, or date an account was opened or closed ; or any other information in a consumer report about an account or relationship with you that affects the consumer 's creditworthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or lifestyle.

This is a complaint arising under Sections 5 ( a ), 5 ( m ), 13 ( b ), and 16 ( a ) of the Federal Trade Commission Act ( FTC Act ), 15 U.S.C. 45 ( a ), 45 ( m ) ( 1 ) ( A ), 53 ( b ), and 56 ( a ) ; the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681-1681x ; and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S.C. 1692-1692p, to obtain monetary civil penalties, a permanent injunction, restitution, disgorgement, and other equitable relief for the Defendants violations of the FCRA, the FDCPA, and Section 5 of the FTC Act. 
TRANSUNION provides consumer personal credit reports to regional and national credit grantors, attempting to issue both commercial and consumer credit. TRANSUNION regularly furnishes consumer credit reports to Creditors electronically. TRANSUNION is an entity who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to one or more Creditors about its transactions or experiences with its consumers. 
TRANSUNION routinely receives complaints from consumers who claim they do not owe the debt or that an account is invalid or incorrect. In numerous instances, I have notified TRANSUNION at the address specified for such disputes that TRANSUNION is reporting inaccurate information concerning my consumer credit. As a victim of identity theft and the TRANSUNION S Data Breach I expect the information in my consumer report to be accurate and my disputes taken seriously. 
TRANSUNION has continued to report inaccurate information to the Creditors even after receiving such notice and accompanying proof. In numerous instances, I have disputed the information appearing on my consumer credit report in writing to TRANSUNION. TRANSUNION receives most notices of disputes from a consumer in electronic format, through automated consumer dispute verification ( ACDV ) forms provided on TRANSUNION S website. 
Pursuant to Section 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) of the FCRA, TRANSUNION, as a furnisher of information to the Creditors, is required to conduct an investigation of the disputed information upon receipt of a notice of dispute from a Consumer. For certain types of disputes, such as those where the consumer claims the account is not his or hers or belongs to someone with a similar name, it is TRANSUNION s policy and practice only to compare the name, social security number, date of birth, and address in TRANSUNION s computer database with the information provided on ACDV forms. Where three of the four items match, TRANSUNION will report to the Consumer that it has verified the information it furnished as accurate. It is TRANSUNION s policy that only after the consumer has alleged the same type of account inaccuracy more than four times will the matter become assigned to a supervisor to do further investigation. Because TRANSUNION collects accounts that are often old, information in its computer files may not be accurate for a variety of reasons, including incorrect updating of addresses, errors in recording names and information, and problems with the original Creditors records. 
In disputes involving identity theft or fraud allegations, TRANSUNION s policies provide that if the existing account codes and notes in its records do not contain any reference to a prior claim of fraud, TRANSUNION will verify the previously reported information without conducting any investigation prior to such verification. In numerous instances, despite written or oral notification from consumers disputing the accuracy or completeness of alleged debts, TRANSUNION continued to furnish the information to the Creditors without communicating that the information was disputed by the consumer. Section 623 ( a ) of the FCRA describes the duties of furnishers to provide accurate information to Creditors. Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) prohibits furnishers from providing information relating to a consumer to any Creditor if i. the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address specified by the person for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate ; and ii. the information is, in fact, inaccurate. In numerous instances, I have contacted TRANSUNION at the address specified by TRANSUNION to dispute information furnished by TRANSUNION to a Creditor and to notify TRANSUNION that the information is inaccurate. 
In numerous instances, I have also provided information such as the consumers drivers license, social security number, and/or proof of residence to confirm my identity.

Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

Originally, I was cosigner on a mortgage note that I subsequently included in a now discharged Bankruptcy. The co-borrower and I were given instructions for her to retain property post Bankruptcy. The Co-borrower was instructed to complete an acquisition inquiry where they assess her ability to pay. She did successfully complete a loan modification, not including my income or information with Bay view, and without my completing any reaffirmation paperwork. On contrary, at the time I signed all required papers to relinquish any property claims. However, Bayview had failed to stop reporting to the credit bureaus for the note. However, when I call they say I am not on the note, but reported significant lates XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. The mortgage has since been sold off to XXXX XXXX XXXX, In which case XXXX XXXX XXXX does not report to my credit.

However, over the last 6-months I have been aggressive in trying to get this resolved and consistently hit a brick wall. First, I was directed to XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX XXXX XXXX direct me to Bayview, I filed disputes directly with credit Bureaus. The credit Bureaus stated it is for Bayview to correct. XX/XX/XXXX I finally was submitted to the escalation center at Bayview Florida office to assist with the issue.

I recorded a voicemail, and disclosed as much to the representative. Who then returned my call furious and refused to speak with me verbally. She said I would receive something in the mail in 30-days. I was going to file a complaint then but was in the midst of trying to get a mortgage and had feared that it would cause further delay. SO, in thinking the information that was sent was sufficient I waited. The-30-days expired around XX/XX/XXXX with no update or response. I called back in, and they now claim they do not see who I was dealing with, and can not disclose any information cause I am not on the loan.

I reached out to Discover immediately to inform them that I added the external bank account. However, it was too late. Discover had already deactivated my online access. 

I've had one Discover login to manage both my Discover credit card and Discover bank accounts for several years. Everything has ran smoothly up until 10 days ago. 

After Discover took the step of deactivating my online access after mistakenly detecting some kind of fraud on the account, I had to spend an hour on the phone trying to reactivate it. After following all the steps and suggestions on the phone. There is an error after I log in with the account. I can see the accounts listed, but there is an error message next to each account that said : "" verify this account. '' Any link that I clicked on including "" verify this acount '' led to an error page. All of the links inside of the online account led to error pages. 

I reached out to Discover by phone and chat immediately to let them know what's going on. I can't access my accounts. I can not do anything with any of the accounts. It's very frustrating. I was told on the phone that "" headquarters '' would be working to fix it. 

Over ten days later and there has been no communication what-so-ever from headquarters. No e-mail. I'm traveling overseas right now and e-mail is the best way to reach me. But no other form of communication from DIscover. No solutions. It hasn't been fixed. 

I've chatted multiple times. There is something bizarre with Discover 's chat support. I send a message and then verify my account info. Then I don't get another reply from Discover 's support agent for another 20 minutes. After 15 minutes the chat times out. It has nothing to do with the Internet connection, it's that literally the support agent is taking up to 30 minutes to reply. It's like there is one person trying to service 300 support requests at the same time? What is going on with Discover? I've never seen such poor online customer support in my whole life. 

On XXXX, the official Discover account asks me to open the chat and the whole thing repeats. I verify my account through chat, and then it takes 20 - 30 minutes to get a reply from the agent or no reply ever comes. This problem that is not my fault, and caused by Discover never gets solved. I wish I could be compensated somehow for how much time I've wasted trying to get it resolved. It's so crazy. 

I've called twice on this issue. Each time I can get through to their U.S support, which is good. But again, each time they say they've reported the issue to their headquarters and there is nothing else they can do at all. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I got an e-mail from Discover with a temporary password. I thought for a moment that they finally fixed the issue and I could now log in. But I try to log in with the temporary password and it doesn't work. 

I'm so disappointed by the lack of communication, lack of a solution, and the fact that this whole thing was caused by a mistake by Discover just for linking an external account to Discover. I've never seen anything like this before, and never experienced any problem like this before with any other financial company.

2081856,"This is regarding a Short Sale negotiation, the XXXX mortgage is not willing to accept the only thing a XXXX loan can offer XXXX XXXX XXXX. They would rather foreclose and net Webster Bank nothing. The XXXX lean, buyers, sellers, attorneys, the court and judge all agreed to the Short Sale and the XXXX mortgage bank is preventing the short sale. I have spoke to a number of attorneys who feel this behavior is irresponsible. 
A request has been submitted to Webster Bank, as the holder of a XXXX mortgage several time between last XXXX and now. This last time we waited XXXX days and over a phone call XXXX told me the Short Sale was rejected : The bank would prefer to foreclose and get NOTHING as opposed to getting what is allowed by XXXX ( XXXX ) for a XXXX lean, as every other bank accepts in this unfortunate situation. Sounds like a bad financial decision, considering the bank charges higher interest for the XXXX and it was insured. This decision now rendered nearly a year after deliberations on Webster 's part, wasting not only attorney 's, realtors, and buyers time but also the court 's, the judge 's and the tax payer 's time and money. And, not to even speak of the waste of your employees time and the additional bank money wasted - by dragging the process out. OR, Webster would agree to the short sale if they can lean a house, in a homestead state, worth far less than the loan balance. Lived in by a person with only social security as an income. Knowing perfectly well ( after seeing her balance sheets, multiple times ) that this individual could never pay any loan back ( no less keep up with her monthly expenses ). The sellers have suffered extreme hardship. They tried to sell the house at a price to cover the mortgages for over 2 years. Then they started the short sale process, lost several offers in the process - because the buyers would no longer wait for the bank to decide and for this last offer the buyer has waited for the banks for XXXX XXXX years and Webster comes back with this response. As you can see, Webster rejects the XXXX offered by XXXX. They would rather foreclose. If that was the case why did n't they say so from the beginning? Then Webster suggested that they lean a small house that is worth far less than the loan. That 's not securing a loan it 's having no regard for a Senior with health issues and on a fixed income. The sellers are both seniors on fixed incomes of only social security for XXXX XXXX and full XXXX for XXXX XXXX. This couple is separated. The XXXX mortgage approved the short sale in XXXX but but Webster has been holding out. We have been to court a number of times to update the first mortgage holder and to get the dates extended so we can finish the short sale. The sellers are asking that Webster approve the short sale, one that they have been working on since 2014. In my experience I have never seen a bank behave with such cruel and calculated actions. Webster has their financials, it is obvious the situation is irreversible and they are living month to month. Short Sales are solutions.

They then sent out a letter two months AFTER the sale acknowledging that my loan was delinquent ( state law requires this letter to be sent out prior to the sale ) and that they wanted to work with me towards a modification -- -even though the house was sold at auction on XX/XX/XXXX. So I know that something is up. 

Clearspring lied to me, misled me and made misrepresentations to me. My first piece of evidence is the recorded phone call from XX/XX/2016 when their representative XXXX was asked the question, "" is there a sale date on this property? '' approximately 3:20 into the call. She said she would look and then responded at approximately the 4 minute mark of the phone call that there was not a sale date at the time. ( sound file of call attached ) However, the property was sold at foreclosure auction on XX/XX/XXXX. Not only did Clearspring fail to notify me, they also failed to publish the notice of sale in the newspaper as required by law for the requisite 4 weeks. Then to further illustrate the amount of fraud being perpetrated by ClearSpring a letter was received on XX/XX/XXXX ( attached ) from ClearSpring, informing me that my mortgage payment is now more than 30 days past due and offering to try and work the situation out. 

Under Michigan law this letter was supposed to be sent PRIOR to the sale. This is a futile attempt by ClearSpring to cover their tracks. Even more unbelievable is that XXXX sent a package to complete so that I can be reviewed for loan modification, even though they told me that my house was already sold and that I am only still there because of the redemption period and that I am still in the house because there is a redemption period in Michigan.

They have attempted to state that the home was auctioned off because the bankruptcy was no longer active, yet for some reason ClearSpring did not follow the notification laws as required in the state of Michigan. 

I make enough money to afford a reasonable payment and was engaged with ClearSpring in the modification process when I was blindsided with the news that the property had been sold.

Summary : TransUnion has failed to comply with multiple provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) despite my previous dispute and their formal response dated XX/XX/year>, which they closed with non-monetary relief. The account remains in Active Dispute status, indicating that it has not been verified as accurate and continues to appear on my credit report in violation of federal law. 

Details of Non-Compliance XXXX. Violation of FCRA 1681e ( b ) Failure to Maintain Maximum Possible Accuracy TransUnion continues to publish the XXXX Money account with contradictory, incomplete, and unverified data. 

Reporting an account as Active Dispute is an acknowledgment that it has not been fully verified or corrected, which fails the FCRAs maximum possible accuracy standard. 

The same account reflects inconsistent information compared with Equifax and Experian ( different high credit limits, dates of last activity, and payment history ), confirming the absence of accurate and consistent data maintenance. 

XXXX. Violation of FCRA 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Reinvestigation TransUnions response merely states that the matter was reviewed and closed without providing evidence that any reasonable reinvestigation was performed. 

No documentation or verification materials from the furnisher ( XXXX XXXX ) were provided. 

The FCRA requires that a consumer reporting agency conduct a substantive, documented reinvestigationnot simply contact the furnisher and accept their confirmation. 

XXXX. Violation of FCRA 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ) Duty to Delete Unverifiable Information When a reinvestigation fails to fully verify information, the consumer reporting agency must delete the disputed data. 

Leaving the XXXX XXXX account as Active Dispute instead of deleting it demonstrates that TransUnion has admitted the information can not be fully verified, yet continues to report it. 

This is a direct violation of 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ). 

XXXX. Violation of FCRA 602 ( a ) Failure to Uphold Fair and Reliable Reporting Standards Congress established that credit reporting must be fair, accurate, and impartial. 

By continuing to publish a disputed, inconsistent account under the active dispute label, TransUnion is undermining the integrity of the credit reporting system and damaging my creditworthiness. 

Requested Resolution I am formally requesting that the CFPB require TransUnion to delete the XXXX XXXX  account from my credit report in accordance with FCRA 1681e ( b ), 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), and 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ). 

The account has been : flagged as disputed, subject to contradictory data across bureaus, inadequately reinvestigated, and maintained in my file despite being unverifiable. 

This ongoing publication of inaccurate information constitutes willful and negligent noncompliance under FCRA 616617, for which statutory damages may be pursued if unresolved.

Please allow me to explain : I went through a divorce about XXXX years ago, at which time, I gave the title to our home to now my ex-wife.

Although I continued to send the necessary funds to her each month to cover that mortgage, she pocketed the money and did not pay. I asked my attorney if I could withhold those funds each month from her and pay the mortgage myself, at which time i was advised that it would be illegal to do so. So this went on for several months despite both my attorney and myself saying we would have to take this to court. After about XXXX months of non payment, we did take this to court in XXXX of 2012. She was found to be in contempt of court and ordered to bring the mortgage current within XXXX months and make the expected payments in the future. She ignored this court order and never paid a dime for the mortgage, despite my continuing to pay her the money to do so. This went on for a period of XXXX months until she put the house up for short sale. In the meantime my credit score continued to plument though no fault of my own.

Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence, which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system.

This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2.

I've discovered recently that Dovenmuehle Mortgage failed to make full payment of my property tax for XX/XX/XXXX. They instead made two installments. One half was made XX/XX/XXXX and the other XX/XX/XXXX. Furthermore, for XXXX, they completely failed to pay property tax by the deadline set by XXXXhe county where I reside. I had to contact Dovenmuehle to make the property tax payment from my escrow account for XXXX which included late fees and penalties. The funds were in my account. I make payments to my escrow account each month and it has always been in good standing. 
So for two years since the onset of my new mortgage account, Dovenmuehle has mishandled the escrow funds. For the most recent of XXXX property tax, I contacted Dovenmuehle and was told that they paid the bill according to the county tax bill two pay option and refused to pay it any differently. I asked for escalation to discuss with a supervisor who told me the same. After repeatedly stating that their payment method was unacceptable to me, the supervisor finally offered to allow me to handle my own escrow account for property taxes. This was never before offered as an option and took a lot of time and effort on my part to get that option offered to me. Of course I accepted that option and am now awaiting paperwork to transfer the escrow account from Dovenmuehle to me.

Citizen 's did not tell us. We found out by a neighbor who read our name and that the XX/XX/XXXX taxes were sold to someone as a lien. Now the second ( certificate ) will be sold next week. We keep trying to get this straightened out by the bank and getting nowhere. Following is most if not all of the information you may need : The following is a brief summary of the timeline for the above issue : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX : Received a call from our son who lives in the same community as the above address in XXXX , because he received a call from our neighbor that our house was in the paper, listed as having two years delinquent taxes. I told him we have an escrow account with Citizens Bank, but I would look into it the next day. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXX county tax site showed that our taxes were two years delinquent ( XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ), and the XX/XX/XXXX was sold as a certificate to an outside investor. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXX ( owner ) called XXXX at Citizens Mortgage Department to notify her of the delinquency. She told XXXX it would take 15 Business days to look into the issue. She was told that we did not have 15 days before the next certificate would be sold. XXXX also acknowledged that {$6400.00} was sent to the XXXX County Tax Department on XX/XX/XXXX, but the check was sent back. It was the wrong amount. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXX called XXXX County tax Department to get further clarification on why the check was sent back to Citizens Bank. The tax agent said the check was for about {$2500.00} less than the actual tax and their policy is to send checks back if they are not the correct amount. She also told XXXX that the XX/XX/XXXX delinquent tax certificate was sold at a premium and the XX/XX/XXXX tax delinquency could be sold at any time. She recommended we pay the XX/XX/XXXX certificate of {$9100.00}. immediately, which is higher than the original amount. The XXXX county policy is to put property up for auction if three years taxes are delinquent and we already had two years. Also, if the XX/XX/XXXX tax certificate was sold it can not be bought back without paying a premium. We have been advised not to pay this, as federal law states, because it is the fault/mistake of the bank, they have to pay all expenses incurred. Besides, it was already in our escrow account. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXX Called Citizens again and spoke to XXXX who said the matter is being looked at and takes 15 days to investigate. XXXX told XXXX that we do not have 15 days before the second certificate would be sold before that time. XXXX told him that the whole problem was because Citizens has not paid our full taxes out of our escrow, but paying partial payments which were sent back by XXXX Co, as they do not accept partial payments. Our check was sent back without explanation. XXXX was obstinate and said only that thats our policy. XXXX told him that Citizens is responsible for all costs incurred by their mistake ( Federal law ). XXXX finally forwarded the call to XXXX in customer service. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX told XXXX that she would get someone to expedite this. She also said she would send it to the chairmans department as an expedited complaint.

Weve called XXXX and left messages on her voice mail seven times between XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX and still have not heard from anyone. IMPORTANT POINTS : 1. Why werent we informed we had a problem with the tax account prior to XX/XX/XXXX? 2. Why did we have to hear this through a neighbor? As we are trying to set up a XXXX XXXX there, this issue can cause big problems, as our name was in the paper. 3.

By federal law, Citizens Bank has a fiduciary responsibility to calculate our escrow accurately and pay our taxes in a timely manner. They were told that they were short. 6. Citizens Bank is legally responsible for late fees and penalties for these taxes, however what are they going to do about the embarrassment and damage to our reputations by allowing this to happen and become public knowledge?

I first became aware of this account when I reviewed my credit report, as I have no recollection of ever having entered into a lease or credit agreement with XXXX XXXX. Upon noticing this on my report, I immediately reached out to XXXX XXXX XXXX for clarification. They, in turn, directed me to Sage Capital Recovery, who is apparently managing the debt. 

As part of my dispute, I requested a debt validation from Sage Capital Recovery. The documents they provided, which I have attached for your reference, do not contain any signature, identification, or any form of proof that I ever consented to or authorized this account. The validation documentation lacks any evidence of my agreement to this debt. 

Furthermore, I would like to bring to your attention the consent order issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau against XXXX XXXX. This order permanently bans XXXX XXXX from offering or providing consumer leases and requires them to release all consumers from their existing lease agreements without further financial obligation. This order should logically encompass the account being reported in my name. 

Despite providing XXXX XXXX XXXX and Sage Capital Recovery with the aforementioned court order and disputing the legitimacy of this account due to the lack of proper validation, both companies have failed to take any action to remove this account from my credit report. This inaction has caused undue harm to my credit, and I believe it is in direct violation of my rights as a consumer under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

As such, I am requesting the following : Immediate removal of this account from all credit reports : Due to the lack of proper debt validation and the application of the CFPBs consent order against XXXX XXXX, this account should not be reported. 

Investigation of Sage Capital Recovery and XXXX XXXX XXXX : Both companies have refused to remove the account from my credit report despite being presented with the lack of validation and the CFPBs enforcement order against XXXX XXXX. 

Appropriate penalties or corrective actions : I request that the CFPB ensure that both Sage Capital Recovery and XXXX XXXX XXXX are held accountable for their failure to act in accordance with consumer protection laws and the court order. 

I have attached all relevant documentation, including the consent order from the CFPB, the correspondence from Sage Capital Recovery, and the debt validation documents ( which do not contain any signature or evidence of my consent ). 

I would appreciate your swift attention to this matter, as it continues to impact my financial standing. If any further information is needed, please feel free to contact me at ( XXXX ) XXXX or XXXX.

I felt that {$350.00} was too much so I found a phone number to call them to cancel the transaction. I was told that the only way to get my money back was to do it online. I explained that I did not do banking online and was told that that would be the only way to get my money back. Of course, I wanted my money back, so I set my banking up on line while I was on the phone with them. Once my online banking was set up, I was told that I would have to enter the amount to be refunded. I entered XXXX, which somehow ended up being XXXX without the decimal point. The person freaked out on the phone and was flabbergasted and told me that I had just taken {$35000.00} from them. I explained that that was not my intent and I would gladly return the money. I was told that it could only be done through a wire transfer. I wanted them to have their money back so I got the information I needed from them and went to my Truist bank branch in XXXX and had the money wired to the beneficiary for which they gave me the information. I was also told to remain on the phone with them during the transaction which I did. This is one of the reasons that I do not feel that I was being protected by Truist bank. I would have hoped that being my bank for almost 30 years, they would have warned me about the possibility of this being a scam. While completing the wire transfer, it was never questioned about the possibility of this being a scam. Once the wire transfer was complete, I left and I spoke again on the phone with the person doing the scam. I was told by the scammer that since I was being so honest that they would clean by computer for free. I was asked to leave my computer on for the next XXXX hours. I was out of town on XX/XX/XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I was contacted again by someone doing the scam regarding the cleaning of my computer. I truthfully do not remember what the conversation was, but it had me so frustrated with the process that I said I was going to go to my bank to see what was going on with my account. He tried tell me that the bank was going to freeze all my accounts if I did this and that I would not have any access to my account. Again, I was so frustrated with everything that I didn't care. I went to another branch of my bank in XXXX to explain what was going on. I spoke with the branch leader II Vice President, XXXX XXXX XXXX who does know me, and told him briefly what was going on. We sat down to looked up my account and he verified that there was an attempt to wire money, but it had been denied. He did tell me however that it looked like there was {$35000.00} transferred to my account. I told him that was not my money and that was why I did the wire to try to give the money back. I was told again that the wire transfer did not go through and it looked like I scammed the scammers and that everything was fine with my account. There was nothing else unusual. I also went back on XX/XX/XXXX and asked him to verify that there was nothing unusual going on with my accounts. I again was told that everything was fine and that I had an extra {$35000.00} in my account and that the wire did not go through. 

It was not until I didnt receive my bank statements in the mail as I usually would, that I went back to that same bank branch to have them printed out. XXXX XXXX XXXX did explain that since I opened my banking on-line that I was no longer receiving them in the mail like I had always done in the past. I asked him to print them out and sat down with him for about an hour to see if the money was still there. I was consistently told by XXXX that my money was still there and that it had just been moved around. I still was not seeing it and could tell that he was getting frustrated with me. After about an hour, I left to sit down with my statements and see what I could figure out. I concluded that the money he saw coming into my checking account was actually from other accounts that I have with Truist. This was verified when I sat down with another person, XXXX XXXX at the XXXX branch who went through my statements with me. At that time, I filed a fraud claim with the bank. Since then, I have been in touch with my broker and another member at the bank.

I have never received any positive communication from XXXX   XXXX about this account status. No phone call, no certified letter, no email receipt of confirmation about this issue. 

I thought my account was being paid with an automatic withdrawal that I had set up. It turns out that debt card was canceled due a bunch of XXXX debit cards being compromised about 10 months ago ( sorry, it's easy to overlook small charges of {$4.00} ). 

I have been a customer with XXXX  12-15 years. I have paid about {$5.00} dollars a month for a water cooler lease ( 12months X {$5.00} X 12 years = {$720.00} at least ) for that time.

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and so she did not know how to get a job. She asked for money but I offered to pay for the baby food items. We both went to the till and I paid what was to me {$27.00} in total. After making payment for her items, I gave her the phone number for XXXX XXXX XXXX  where she could get XXXX XXXX help and also get food supplies for her family. I made sure that I stayed with her until she called the XXXX XXXX  and booked the appointment to go there the next day XX/XX/24. I gave her the receipt in case she needed to exchange the items and I went back into XXXX for my own shopping. 

However in the evening, I found that the amount charged for the baby items were {$260.00} plus and I contacted Chase back to report the fraud. The money was credited to my account. 

Few days after I got a call which I did not recognize and allowed the call to go to voicemail. In the voicemail, the caller said they were calling from Chase Bank and I called Chase to confirm if they had called me from that number and the gentleman that I spoke with said the call was not from Chase Bank and that I should be careful. 

Few days after the call with chase about the call that went to my voicemail, the money credited to me by chase, for the claim, was reversed. When I called to enquire, I was told that it was because I had rejected multiple attempts of Chase to reach me via phone calls and I explained that a Chase representative told me not to call back. I was also told that Chase had sent me a letter in the mail and I explained that I had chosen a paperless communication method with the bank and that I would have expected an email and not a mail. Unfortunately, the Chase representative seemed hostile and accusatory and so I requested to speak to a manager who then told me to get a receipt from XXXX to substantiate the claim. 

On XX/XX/24, I went to XXXX XXXX and was issued the transaction history which showed that the items purchased on XX/XX/24 were all returned at another XXXX store XXXX XXXX at XXXX on XX/XX/24. I was advised to visit the XXXX XXXX store and I did.

He said he decided to check the camera coverage at XXXX instead, but no one did a return of any baby items at that time. He asked me to go back to the XXXX XXXX to investigate further. 

When I went back to the XXXX store, the manager went to check the camera and confirmed that he saw myself and the lady for whom I purchased the item. He said he could see that I was distracted chatting with the lady and the camera showed her leaving with the items but that was all. 

I uploaded the transaction history onto the chase claim and submitted. A few days later I called to enquire about the claim and was told that the claim was rejected for the 2nd time and that there was no way of reopening it.

I logged on to see the claim and was surprised to see that Chase had captured a completely different reason for the claim.

8598859,"On XX/XX/2024 at XXXX XXXX., I attempted to deposit {$300.00} in cash into the drivethru outside ATM of the JP Morgan Chase bank located at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, XXXX This particular drive-thru ATM has had numerous problems and issues making deposits over the past couple of years that I've been noticing. I've even had the ATM stop working midway through my transaction and after 5 minutes it spit my money back out and the screen read that the atm was temporarily out of service and I had to go inside to use the ATM to make my deposit.. 

On XX/XX/2024 when I attempted to deposit {$300.00} into the drivethru ATM, it started to flip out again and eventually it returned several bills to me that I ended up having to pick and dig out of the money puller because it wouldn't spit the money all the way out. This ended up being exactly {$25.00} in {$1.00} bills that the ATM returned to me..Next, the ATM stated on the screen that if I wanted to continue with the deposit that two additional bills would be returned to me. So I said okay I'll just take the rest inside to deposit because this ATM machine is flipping out again. 

After waiting nearly 5 minutes to get the two bills returned to me and hearing all kinds of mechanical movings going on inside the machine, the ATM eventually just printed out a receipt and said thank you like everything was fine, only i hadn't been returned the 2 bills that the machine stated would be returned.. 

The receipt ends up stating that I had a cash deposit of {$240.00}, and after accounting for the {$25.00} cash that was returned it would make it $ XXXXSo I was missing exactly {$40.00} which was the 2 bills that the atm stated would be returned and never was before the transaction was finalized and that would have been 2 {$20.00} bills... 

Never having gone thru this before, I had no idea how to correct this problem but contact the bank the next morning which was Monday XX/XX/2024..After calling this particular Chase Bank, they immediately gave me an XXXX number to call which handled all ATM issues and I eventually ended up putting in a claim for this {$40.00} that I was missing.. The operator who I was talking to didn't seem to understand what I was saying so I repeated myself several times that my entire deposit which should have been {$300.00} ended up turning into only {$240.00} deposit after the ATM spit out {$25.00} in {$1.00} bills and never returned the two additional bills that it said it will return but ultimately didnt.. 

So at the end of the day my account is short {$40.00} and since I put this claim in they ended up putting in a temporary credit for the entire XXXX I didn't ask for them to return {$300.00} to me, I asked for the return of the {$40.00} that i was shorted.. 

Now on today XX/XX/2024 I get an email that I have a notice in my online checking account concerning this claim. And it stated that their calculations are correct that my entire {$300.00} was deposited and thats impossible since i had {$25.00} in my pocket that was returned to me by the ATM as well as the {$40.00} thats still missing..The receipt clearly shows only {$240.00} was deposited and I was returned {$25.00} all in {$1.00} bills and that's a discrepancy of XXXX 

This is what I stated or had my son state for me on the recorded line since I have hearing problems..They advised that they were recording the conversation and if they were recording this then they can go back and play this over..I never said I was missing {$300.00} I was missing {$40.00}. And now they're saying they're going to withdraw the entire {$300.00} out of my account on or before the XX/XX/2024. 

They never should have credited my account the entire {$300.00} in the first place because I didn't ask for that, I asked only for what I was missing which was {$40.00} which was those two bills that the ATM never returned and the ATM also did it's normal routine of breaking down right after it didn't return those two bills. I am not going to allow this bank to take {$40.00} from me because they can't find their error. It shouldn't be my burden to prove this ATM 's error when I'm sure whoever went out and serviced that particular ATM would have clearly seen that money was probably jammed in that ATM somewhere.",Checking or savings account,Managing an account,3

9459393,"I am writing to formally file a complaint against my mortgage servicer, Cross Country Mortgage, regarding significant issues with their website and payment portal. 

In XXXX, 2024 my mortgage was transferred to Cross Country Mortgage. I had no issues with my previous servicer 's payment system. However, I have encountered multiple problems with the new servicer 's website. 

Firstly, the payment portal only displays the last four digits of the bank account number. My bank increments the middle digits, not the last four, which if i'm being honest has caused the confusion in the first place since I can not verify the account number on the servicers website. Recently, I started using a separate account that coincidentally ends with the same last four digits. 

In XX/XX/year>, I deleted the old bank account information I was making payments with and added the new account details. After making a payment using the saved information, the wrong account was charged. I immediately contacted the servicer to report a potential backend system issue, as I had deleted the old account and entered the new one. The servicer conducted an investigation but determined it was not their fault. I accepted this conclusion as a mistake on my end. 

To avoid further issues, I deleted the saved account and added the new one again when making both XXXX and XXXX 's payments. However, during XXXX 's payment cycle, I decided to use the saved payment information, believing it would be safe. Unfortunately, the old account was charged again, indicating a recurring problem with the servicer 's backend system. 

As a result of these issues, I have incurred {$60.00} worth of NSF ( Non-Sufficient Funds ) fees this year, with each instance costing {$30.00}. This is causing financial harm and undue stress. 

I have formally requested the servicer provide logs of my saved payment entries and the corresponding values, but they have refused to do so. I believe there is a backend database issue causing my saved payment information to be overwritten at some point. However I can't verify whether it's right or wrong account since it only shows the last 4. I servicer also can not verify my current saved information either. 

I am requesting the CFPB 's assistance in resolving this matter. The servicer 's refusal to provide the requested logs is unacceptable, and their system 's deficiencies are causing significant inconvenience and financial harm.

The inability to obtain employment due to this adverse action has crippled me financially and caused severe damage to my mental health. 
I was advised by a legal friend that under 15 U.S.C. 1681a, Section 603 ( k ) ( 1 ) ( B ) ( ii ), this can be considered an adverse action. Despite my previous request, the matter remains unresolved.

On XX/XX/2016 I spoke to XXXX XXXX XXXX of SPS regarding the short sale of XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, IL. in a recorded conversation I was faced w/a nasty attitude and told me it was set for foreclosure. I then called back on XXXX/XXXX/16 along with my realtor XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX and spoke w/XXXX who then transferred me to a XXXX XXXX, Loss Litigation & her Supv. XXXX XXXX of SPS in a recorded conversation that said the short sale was denied because my attorney 's office along w/my realtor did not get proper change of buyer forms in by XXXX/XXXX/16. This was untrue as all of this information was submitted accordingly. They went on claiming that we could not close and have a short sale in which I was entitled to {$10000.00} under the HAFA which is in writing. Proof of funds was there by XX/XX/2016. My attorney 's office ( at that time ) also called SPS & explained everything was presented accordingly. SPS continued to give all of us the runaround purposely. SPS kept pursuing "" Cash for Keys for {$3000.00} instead ''. Prior to this, SPS had faxed to XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Realtor that the Short Sale had been approved by XXXX XXXX XXXX, Senior Vice President of Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc., and all they needed at that time was hardship letter which was submitted XX/XX/2016. For approximately 2 weeks I did not hear anything from SPS and neither did my realtor since XX/XX/2016. Then I received multiple letters DATED XX/XX/2016 but not RECEIVED UNTIL XX/XX/2016 postmarked XX/XX/2016 ( pre-dated on letter ) that SPS and their attorneys XXXX XXXX XXXX had scheduled another Foreclosure date of XX/XX/2016 instead of a Short Sale although SPS would tell my realtor differently as she spoke to several different individuals at SPS and had her resubmitted paperwork including current utility bills for a short sale. I went into the hospital on XX/XX/2016 to have a procedure as I am a XXXX XXXX. On XXXX I called and finally got this alleged XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX and tried to explain to him I was in the hospital which was relayed by my realtor, I was disputing the foreclosure and wanted to know what I could do since I was told they needed 38 days for a Short Sale, XXXX XXXX was very nasty and short with me and said it was nothing for me to do but to accept the "" Cash for Keys for {$3000.00} '' ), I told him this was wrong because I did not even received all XXXX letters until XX/XX/2016 and that was LESS THAN 30 days notice for me the consumer and property owner notification of a foreclosure and it was n't fair and violated my consumer rights. He said he did not care and that was not his concern or problem and SPS would give me 30 days to vacate and kept saying it was my realtor 's error in which it was not as different ones gave her the runaround and told her a short sale could be pursued.

4765038,"To the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau : CenterState Bank participated in fraud. CenterState Bank is now SouthState Bank. I have been trying to collect this fraud claim since 2012 and since then they had a big merge with another very wealthy bank. They merged during the pandemic smoothly with ease and made them even more wealthy. I tried many, many times to report this to them and have the appropriate action but they chose to protect the participants of fraud. They have refused since 2012 to re-imburse me for fraud, even though their bank clearly has a fraud policy of restoring the victim funds. There are several involved in this fraud including bank employees. There are two bank managers, two lawyers involved and three employees who all obstructed any investigations. They split up about {$250000.00}. They embezzled in just 32 days {$92000.00}. I have every document and every cancelled check and every forged signature. 

I was the only signer on this account and not responsible for fraud, but this was covered up, so they refused to give back my money stolen by fraud. They circumvented law enforcement investigations. 

The bank policy is clear. The victim is not responsible for fraud. This has been my premise from the beginning. I had no signers on this account except me and only me. I was the only signer on the signature card. 

This bank destroyed me and my family while protecting embezzlers. They went way out of their way to protect their two bank managers and perpetrators who devised several fraud schemes. Even to the point of threatening me with charges and jail time for asking for my money back that was supposed to be protected by bank policy. This bank created a life-altering hardship that changed the course of my life. The money stolen was my life savings. I can not emphasize enough the destitution and destruction this bank caused. 

One attorney is so powerful that he protected all the perpetrators and obstructed justice. He prevented an investigation, covered for the two bank managers and protected the embezzlers. Three of these individuals committed Identity Theft by stealing my identity as well. One of the bank managers was convicted in a Federal Court for other unrelated bank fraud. 

One of the bank managers lived next door to me and participated in a home burglary while I was away. This bank, CenterState bank, even participated in mortgage and deed fraud in separate instance which I will be reporting. 
This bank manager told me that I called the bank via phone and added signers to this checking account. She said I called and added debit cards for employees as well as added check signers-by phone. I dont know of a bank anywhere where you can verbally call the bank and put a check signer on an account or authorize debit cards to employees over the phone. If this was done, it was not me and I would have never allowed it. 

I did not call this bank and add a check signer to this or any checking account nor did I call to add any debit cards. If I wanted someone to be a signer to my account I would have gone in with that person with the correct identification. They know this and I know this. This claim is ridiculous and fraudulent. This is their only defense except threatening the arrest of me the victim. What would be the point of having a signature card? What would have been the point of me signing the signature card when I opened this checking account? Under this banks excuse is that anyone could call the bank and add themselves as a check signer. 

They used their considerable influence to keep anyone from being prosecuted then used threats to keep from being exposed of bank fraud and mortgage fraud. After I delivered all the documents, evidence and witnesses enclosed in the screen shot their attorney threatened to have me arrested. This was their latest Obstruction of Justice. 
After I compiled a massive list of witnesses, interviews, documents, actual forgeries and an investigation by a private investigator I submitted it all to the bank. I did this during the pandemic. Their response was they were going to have me charged and warned me to be silent and Govern Myself Accordingly which is a threat. This is from a bank where I deposited hundreds of thousands of dollars. I weighed whether I should file this complaint under multiple and continued threats by the bank, but I have done nothing wrong.

8872146,"On XX/XX/XXXX at approximately XXXX XXXX I received an email Withdrawal Notification from Navy Federal Credit Union informing me that {$380.00} was withdrawn from my EveryDay Checking account. Shocked, confused and upset, I contacted NFCU to inquire about and resolve the issue. After several attempts at trying to speak with someone, I was connected with XXXX, who in turn supposedly transferred me to another department for assistance. After being transferred I waited nearly XXXX mins on hold ( without the previous agent coming back to the phone to do a courtesy check ) before finally disconnecting from the call. 

However, soon it dawned on me that the withdrawn funds is the exact amount of a recently submitted claim regarding disputed debit card transaction ( XX/XX/XXXX ) with the merchant XXXX. On Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from NFCU- Requesting Additional Info : "" We could use your help! Strong documentation will greatly assist us in recovering the {$380.00} that may have been charged to your debit card in error by XXXX. '' First of all, with regards to that email and in response, I never indicated to NFCU nor did I indicate it anywhere in my dispute claim that my card was charged in error. What I did state, however, was that I was very dissatisfied with the transaction and provided in depth details surrounding my expectations and results from the service transaction not being met with this particular entity. Secondly, when they sent me that email, I responded to it within 2 days of having received it providing them with the additional information they requested including communications and other supportive evidence and documentations for my claim. I had not heard back from them regarding that claim or my submitted documentation until this recent Withdrawal Notification email I received from them. Funds were unjustifiably, wrongfully and unfairly withdrawn from my checking account. Not only was the business paid in- full for their services at the time of the transaction ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I was never issued a full refund for the transaction by this business. I only received a {$21.00} credit from them after having discovered I had been overcharged for the service. So how dare they double withdraw the amount from my account to give to a business that was already paid. Furthermore, NFCU has never issued me any temporary credit for the withdrawn dollar amount this disputed claim. I have absolutely no record of NFCU ever issuing me a temporary credit for the disputed transaction in the amount of {$380.00}. So, how do you justify a withdrawal in which there was no temporary credit issued for it in the first place? Make it make sense. 

I've noticed that NFCU has definitely changed for the worse with regards to their integrity, dignity, fairness and seemingly now non-existent respect and exceptional customer service to and for all. I've noticed now with this institution that after you've identified yourself via phone with your personal information and or if you're one with multiple disputed transactions and or complaints against a merchant and or NFCU you get treated differently by their phone agents. I guess I am considered an at-risk, problem member, meaning no one cares to really assist you and you find yourself not being helped at all, placed on hold and or transferred and waiting on hold for the next available phone agent for an unusual extended period of time ( without the previous agent coming back to the phone to do a courtesy check ) before you finally decide to disconnect from the call.

I have no doubt this recent withdrawal was done out of spite and with malicious intent. And not to mention there has also been other fairly recent unexplainable, suspicious activity and incident involving this institution in which my in-person check deposit at my local branch was not deposited into my checking account as requested. It was only after I contacted them via phone, that I spoke with a very helpful, mature and seasoned, emphasis on seasoned, representative who went above and beyond to help me by contacting the branch office I visited where I made the deposit that was able to finally get some resolve. And even though, I was contacted by a branch "" manager '' regarding the incident, who by the way admitted no explanation nor wrongdoing on their parts, I am convinced that a fraudulent and suspicious activity regarding my bank deposit and checking account had taken place. In fact the helpful agent that I spoke to via phone regarding the incident advised me that if I had not contacted NFCU about the incident that the alleged "" clerical error '' would not have been discovered and my funds would not have been recovered. That along with the fact that they were able to pull the surveillance footage from the day of my visit to confirm my in-person check deposit. 
I am truly convinced that this incident along with other recent communications and other highly unfavorable and unsatisfactory dealings with this institution, that they are forcing me after 25 years of loyalty to them, that it is finally time to walk away and bank with a more respectable institution that does not operate under bad, shady and discriminatory business practices. As I stated earlier, the money that was withdrawn from my checking account was done so wrongfully and unfairly. There was and is no absolutely no justifiable reason for this institution to have withdrawn that money from my checking account. Absolutely none. Like I said I had never been issued a temporary credit for the aforementioned dispute transaction, nor have I received a full refund from the merchant for that disputed transaction. Therefore, I want my funds credited back to my checking account immediately.",Checking or savings account,Managing an account,5

2952458,"I had an outstanding medical bill of {$790.00} that was sent to collection with Merchants CR. I called them on XX/XX/XXXX to pay this bill and the representative I spoke to told me that XXXX ( who the medical bill was from ) was offering me a settlement for {$600.00} so long as I paid it within 30 days. I agreed and set up a payment plan of three payments of {$200.00} using my credit card. The first payment was charged to my credit card on XX/XX/XXXX, the day that I set up the payment plan. The second payment was charged to my credit card on XX/XX/XXXX and the third was charged on XX/XX/XXXX. However, on XX/XX/XXXX I called Merchant about a different medical bill that I had paid through the doctors office to see if it had come out of my account and while we were on the phone, the representative I was speaking to mentioned that I still had an outstanding balance of {$790.00} from XXXX. I told him that I had already set up a payment plan and that {$400.00} had already been charged to my credit card. He had no record of this anywhere and I ended up having to fax them a copy of my credit card statement to prove that the money came out. It took them until Friday the XXXX to finally resolve the issue. The woman I set up the payment plan with had applied my money to someone else 's account, but they didn't know whose so essentially they lost my money and their accountant had to go and find it. When they called to tell me that they had located my {$400.00} and applied it to my account, I mentioned that I still had another payment of {$200.00} that was scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX and asked if this was going to be applied to my account or if it was still set up to be applied to someone else 's account. They assured me that they fixed everything and that the final payment would be applied to my account and then also told me that I owed another {$36.00} because the settlement was actually for {$630.00} even though the woman I spoke to told me it was only for {$600.00}. I disputed this and told them that the woman set the payment plan up for {$600.00} and that is the amount I agreed on, therefore that is the amount I'm going to pay. They said that was fine and that they'd take off the {$36.00}. Fast forward to last Friday, XX/XX/XXXX. I called them just to make sure everything was good to go and that my balance was settled. They told me that I still owe {$230.00}. I told them that we had already disputed the extra {$36.00} and that the last {$200.00} had already come out of my account XX/XX/XXXX. They said they have no idea where the last {$200.00} is and assured me they would fix it and asked me to give them a call a back Monday or Tuesday. I just got off the phone with them and when I called they said the same thing : "" The {$400.00} we received for your account, but it looks like you still owe {$230.00} ''. It was like the person I spoke to Friday had no recollection of the conversation we had just had. He'd done nothing to try and fix the issue and told me he has no idea how this happened and that his accountant who was able to find and apply the first {$400.00} to my account is out on vacation. This has been going on for over a month now. I've had to take time out of my day at work to call them several times because they keep losing my money. If I hadn't called them last Friday to check and see that all my accounts were paid off, they still would've had me owing {$230.00} to them that I do not owe. No one there seems to know what's going on and none of them seem to know how to fix this issue. Every time I think that it's finally fixed, it turns out that it isn't. I do not trust this company with my money.

6126049,"Hello, Firstly I hope that whoever this message finds does that with them experiencing good health & spirit, and I thank them for using their time assisting me with my current issues. I have to tell you the story starting back in XXXX leading up to our current standing, that's really how long this situation has been kicking me down. In XXXX I started helping someone I had considered a friend and trustworthy by offering him somewhere to stay until his luck turned around. 
His name was XXXX XXXX, I met him at the pool at our apartment complex. He explained how he had recently gone thru a breakup ; he got kicked out of her home that he'd lived in for over a year and now had been sleeping in the Apartment laundry room. I offered him a place on our couch and we went on about life, he didn't have a laptop so I'd let him use mine. He managed to get a job and work for XXXX weeks, my cellphone was due for an upgrade so i sold him my old phone. 
On XX/XX/XXXX my gf, son and daughter went on a camping trip in western NC and XXXX had lived with us for a while without any incident so we thought nothing of it. The trip itself is meant to be a break from "" data '' so it wasnt weird to not have talked to anyone until Monday, when we arrived home a bigger picture was made clear. XXXX was gone with my old phone, was my laptop, and some debit cards, and we couldnt find him. The timing was no coincidence as I had gotten my VA benefits on the XXXX, but with the laptop he had managed to change my direct deposit to an account he had setup. Then with money I had aside in my Bank of America, my XXXX, my XXXX XXXX  and my XXXX  account he transferred, cashed out, and just got it anyway he could. I had never been in a situation like this so I was in uncharted territory, he was playing on my emotions really just buying as much time as he could until I had to call someone. The authorities have basically said they will do their best and do what they can but I know thats a hopeless route I don't want to travel, I don't even know his real name. 
I called Bank of America as soon as I found out what happened and disputed the transactions, I've never underwent their dispute process but had seen its "" XXXX Liability '' tagline numerous times in ads on their page/app. I disputed the transactions on the XXXX and was instructed to call back after all the charges were final, so that's what I did. The representative I spoke with seemed to be challenged regarding the situation, and it's fine if that was the case, at least shes trying. I've tried to assist and provide my notes but the local branch employee stopped replying to me. Since that day I have checked my dispute status daily, diligently watched my inbox, spoke with a local branch employee who said I had messages to respond to which didn't exist when I checked. I was also told I would need a new debit card for the disputes to be paid out to since the account had to be closed, which ended up with me getting XXXX debit cards somehow. I have gotten no guidance, no support, nothing at all, XXXX communication despite me trying. 
I am a service connected XXXX veteran so I'm on a fixed income, and any cushion I did have was gone after XX/XX/XXXX. It is now XX/XX/25 and my circumstance hasn't changed, and yes I was informed that the process could take up to 40 days but they always say that. I basically haven't had any income since XX/XX/XXXX at this point and the strain on my life/wellbeing is adamant. So here I am tossing up a XXXX XXXX after some research on how to proceed, and I am not necessarily asking for the credits ( I certainly wouldn't turn it away ). Some kind of something would be acceptable instead of just feeling insignificant and forgotten. 
Thanks again for assisting me and giving me your time, I've always felt as though time is undervalued and underappreciated as a gift or gesture. It is after all the one thing we can all give but never get back.

PRIOR COMPLAINT : I closed on a property at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX IL XXXX. Us bank much to my horror purchased my account. I was unable to setup autopay because of an existing secure credit card I opened about a year prior and had been unable to close or access the secured funds, even after repeatedly contacting them.

However, after receiving the card I couldnt make a payment to it online and couldnt get a statement sent to me, knowing I still had about XXXX $ credit I closed the account hoping this would clear up mortgage drama plus I cant pay an account they wont give me payment information on. They then held that account open until finance charges applied so they wouldnt have to return any money to me. On XXXX XXXX I went to pay my mortgage and they said I owed almost XXXX instead of XXXX. I said I dont have XXXX I have XXXX. I went from department to department explaining I do not owe the taxes, clearly there has been an error.

I contacted the state of IL and went to XXXX office to submit form and copy of ID proving my status. They stated theyd clear it up. I have all 3 past due mortgage payments. Now theyre stating I owe almost XXXX for this years taxes- again, I dont owe them. This is the law. ALL paperwork was provided in order to write the loan WITHOUT property taxes to get it to clear closing. In the meantime it has come to my attention that this loan should never have been approved. I am missing disclosures from the seller, the hvac collapsed, the window doesnt shut and is stuck open, there is no heat, the foundation wall crack that was repaired is leaking, there is a profound mouse and electrical problem the seller had to have known about.

I have never not been able to pay my mortgage and I can prove this because I am using the money to move out. By failing to accept my payment over a tax bill I provided proof I do not pay AT CLOSING, and then push me into foreclosure while waiting to prove I do not owe taxes us bank has failed their end of this financial obligation and contract in what appears to be a breach of contract. It WILL be cleared up by the state that I do not, in fact, owe taxes. Also- us bank technically would be owing me money over this had they not chosen to refuse the mortgage payment.

Several weeks before closing, as instructed by my new mortgage company, I contacted the old loan company "" Specialized Loan Servicing '' and instructed them not to pay my real estate taxes as the new company would be paying them for me during closing.

6839788,"My father, XXXX XXXX XXXX, was hospitalized and passed away on XX/XX/XXXX. I am the XXXX XXXX XXXX and the named Administrator of his estate. I have been making the payment on the mortgage since XXXX. I contacted Freedom Mortgage via phone ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) once I received my Letter of Administration ( Exhibit A ) from the court to inquire about the process to name me as Successor in Interest ( SII ) for this property ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX TN XXXX ). In this conversation it was not clear what the next steps were, but I was told what documentation would be needed and I provided that via Freedoms online message portal on XX/XX/XXXX ( Exhibit B ). These documents were my Drivers License ( Exhibit C ), the Letter of Administration ( Exhibit A ) and my fathers death certificate ( Exhibit D ). 

Freedom Mortgage responded on XX/XX/XXXX, via the online portal ( Exhibit E ), in which they attached a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX ( Exhibit F ). In this letter, they acknowledge that I am acting as the Executor for the XXXX XXXX property. They also have language in the letter that states If you are aware of any potential successors in interest, please inform us at your earliest convenience in writing etc. I realized weeks later that what they meant was I was REQUIRED to respond to this poorly worded and misleading request and that I tell them in writing what I had already discussed in detail and confirmed both verbally in my phone conversations and in my initial request ( Exhibit B ). In response to this realization, I drafted a formal letter of request ( Exhibit G ) and attached this to a new message that I sent via the online portal ( Exhibit H ). I was extremely clear in this letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, as to my intent and that I was the only person who can be named the SII for my fathers property. 

Freedom Mortgage responded on the online portal on XX/XX/XXXX, via an attached letter dated XX/XX/XXXX ( Exhibit I ). This letter requested additional information in the form of one of two documents Recorded deed or court order transferring the property to you, OR Affidavit of intestate succession In response to this additional request, I worked with my attorney to petition the court to deed the home into mine and my husbands name. This was successfully completed and the property at XXXX XXXX was deeded to myself and my husband on XX/XX/XXXX ( Exhibit J ). 

While I was struggling through this SII process with Freedom Mortgage, I was also working to ensure that the property had appropriate homeowners insurance. In my conversations with my attorney and the insurance agency that was covering the home at the time my dad passed away, they both indicated that I should not do anything and let the existing policy renew in XX/XX/XXXX as scheduled. This was due to the fact that the property was not deeded to me as of yet and I was just XXXX on the estate. Once I had the home deeded in mine and my husbands name to satisfy the Freedom Mortgage requirement, I was told I had to IMMEDIATELY obtain a new policy in our name as the new owners of the home. I contacted Freedom to let them know what I was doing, that I would pay the policy in full. This conversation occurred on XX/XX/XXXX, and I obtained the new policy effective XX/XX/XXXX ( Exhibit K ). Then on XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a message to Freedom via the online message system to include both a copy of the proof of insurance ( Exhibit K ) as well as a copy of the new deed ( Exhibit J ). 

It is my understanding that under RESPA, at this point ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I had provided Freedom with everything needed to name me SII on mine and my husbands property. 

Freedom responded on XX/XX/XXXX via the portal ( Exhibit L ). Please note that they reference the insurance information, but do not acknowledge the actual proof of a paid policy. Additionally, there is no acknowledgement of the SII document or any clear information about what research is being done nor what concern they are addressing. I found this letter also to be misleading and a bit deceptive as to exactly what they were doing to address my very direct request to name SII as well as the work I was required to do to make sure the home was insured. 

I received another message from Freedom via their online message portal on XX/XX/XXXX, where they finally acknowledge the paid policy with XXXX with the policy number and date ( Exhibit M ). Despite this message that should indicate that Freedom noted in their system that I had provided proof of a PAID homeowners policy, on XX/XX/XXXX, they went and paid for hazard insurance AGAIN to XXXX. This is evident from the recent account payment history ( Exhibit N ) from Freedoms website. It is important to mention that on XX/XX/XXXX, the day I called XXXX to obtain this new policy, I also contacted Freedom and talked to someone in their insurance department to inform them I was obtaining and paying in full for this policy so that it would affect my escrow and increase my overall mortgage payment. 

Additionally, once Freedom erroneously paid the policy again, they were very difficult to deal with and instead of requesting the refund from XXXX for their mistake they forced me to request the refund from XXXX ( Exhibit O ). Freedom told me that because this was a batch process on their end that I would have to deal with it. This should not have been my problem to solve, and it ultimately affected my escrow balance and my payment. 

The impact on my escrow was evident in the XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX that Freedom sent me ( Exhibit P ). Please note the escrow shortage noted in the amount of {$460.00}. So, I was in a shortage situation after Freedoms mistake in XXXX, which I remedied the first time with an additional escrow shortage payment of {$640.00} ( Exhibit Q ) which I paid on XX/XX/XXXX. Then I received the escrow statement that suggests if I pay this second escrow shortage of {$460.00}, they will remove the shortage portion of my monthly payment for the XX/XX/XXXX payment. So, I paid the second escrow shortage of {$460.00} on XX/XX/XXXX ( Exhibit R ). But even though I made BOTH shortage payments well in advance of the XXXX installment, as you can see from the payment history, there was no adjustment made as I had to pay the full, new escrow of {$170.00} ( Exhibit S ), which ties back to the XXXX escrow statement ( Exhibit P ) that claims in the FAQs that if I made these shortage payments ( online was offered ) and I identify them as escrow payments, then my payment would no longer have the overage portion of {$38.00} in my payment. To date, Freedom has not offered me very much accurate or reliable information about anything, but I find this situation especially frustrating as I have done everything they have required and several things I should not have to but can not seem to get them to service this loan appropriately. 

Switching back to the XXXX process. To recap, I had sent Freedom the deed on XX/XX/XXXX and as of XX/XX/XXXX, I had not heard an update or been notified that I was named XXXX, so I sent a follow-up message requesting an update on my status as XXXX via the online message portal ( Exhibit T ). The response on XX/XX/XXXX, from Freedom via the online message portal ( Exhibit U ) indicated that the request had been forwarded to their Successor in Interest department. Which was a very interesting response as I had been told during several previous phone conversations that this had happened MONTHS ago. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I received two pieces of paper correspondence in the mail ( not on the online portal ) from Freedom Mortgage ( Exhibit V ). In one letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, they simply state that we have received your correspondence and appreciate your patience while reviewing your inquiry. In the second letter, dated XX/XX/XXXX, they have AGAIN asked for the following - Affidavit of intestate succession Recorded deed/court order transferring the property to you In this version of the letter, there is no use of the word OR and I have already provided the deed transferring the property to me and my husband. It is my understanding from discussing with my attorney that you either obtain the deed OR the affidavit but NOT both. Another deceptive and misleading document and communication from Freedom that is trying to continue to delay this process. Not to mention they have had the deed I provided to them for seven weeks and I had to follow up to find out what my status is. 

In summary, I have been out of the mortgage industry for a decade but spent a career working in this field and I have reached the point where I need to bring this to the Bureau. I am fortunate that I can afford to make up for the mistakes this servicer has made in the administration of this account. The average consumer would have given up on this process, or been put in financial distress over the escrow issues, or worse, they would have been strongarmed into refinancing a low interest, low balance loan so that Freedom could make more profit or at least made enough interest to justify the cost of servicing. Its clear to me that this servicer is delaying and distracting me from taking advantage of a legal right I have under RESPA, and many of their tactics run contrary to the principles of XXXX. I am asking for the Bureaus assistance in helping me to resolve this. All I wish to do is pay this mortgage and keep my fathers home in my family so that I can honor his memory. And I have had to deal with all of this nonsense while I am grieving and doing my best to move forward. Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing the response on this matter.",Mortgage,Trouble during payment process,2

3581480,"Summary : I need and expect 1 ) To be provided by Chase written verification that I have a complete copy of the closing documents they retain on file in my account, and 2 ) To have Chase send to me with that letter in a single and complete package that consists of a complete copy of all the documents from my XX/XX/XXXX mortgage closing that are reproduced in their entirety and properly printed so that the entire content of the documents are displayed. This is necessary because of the numerous errors, improper printing of documents sent, plus the failure by three representatives to identify and provide all the documents. *** At this point I am no longer confident of receipt of the complete mortgage closing document without these two items. I want to receive this information from Chase within one month of this complaint received by Chase or a time frame you consider reasonable. 

If additional information is needed I can provide other details to process this complaint, including sample photos of improperly printed documents, dates when worked with representatives, list of documents incomplete and improperly printed, number of times improperly prepared documents sent, etc. 

Background I misplaced the original of my Chase mortgage refinanced under HARP. In XXXX I contacted Chase customer service to have a hard copy sent to me. To date I have worked with three individuals -- two in customer service, one at a branch in OH. I have yet to to receive all the documents that comprise the documents at closing ( XXXX XXXX ). The initial mailings of the documents from the e-copy of the original were incomplete or not printed properly. Every time I speak to a Chase employee I discover that there is still a document I have not been sent, although twice I have been told everything has been sent. To date, XX/XX/XXXX, I still do not have all the documents in hand. And can not be certain until I receive confirmation of that from Chase. ( All three Chase employees have told me I do have them and they were incorrect. ) On XX/XX/XXXX I called and left a message at the complaint number provided by a Chase customer service representative ( XXXX ) to explain about the problems encountered. No reply. 


In addition to needing to have a complete copy of the mortgage closing documents, if I sell my house I need to be certain I have all the information needed for the sale. One of the Chase representative 's told me if that becomes a problem I can work with Chase 's legal department. I let her know that was not acceptable given the problems encountered to receive a complete usable copy of the documents from my XX/XX/XXXX closing. 


The last person I spoke assured me that I will have all the documents associated when I receive the mailing she sent yesterday. Because of the numerous errors I told her I wanted a letter from Chase verifying that I have been sent a complete copy of the e-file representing the original scanned by Chase and associated with my account. I was told Chase will not do that. To paraphrase her reason : I am asking for Chase to confirm that those providing the documents have done their job, that might have to go through the legal department, and even so said Chase would not send such a letter. I told her I needed to know I had all the files and pursued other means to be certain : 1. I asked to be sent by email all the .pdf files that comprise the original closing documents as I had received some from another. She refused saying that she can not access those files* and that is not allowed**. When I told her someone else had sent some she still refused to send the files and noted she can not access them. 


2. Again, I ask for the letter from Chase confirming I have been sent a copy of all the documents. She refused to pursue such a letter. 


3. I was offered the option of of her accessing the very e-files she told me she could not and sending me a letter listing all the documents so I could check that list against what I have on hand. However, as of XX/XX/XXXX, I was informed that to do this she had obtain permission to send me the list and would know by XX/XX/XXXX. She speculated that if the letter was not approved Chase might opt to print out and send them. I indicated that based on what has happened so far, could very well result in another set of incomplete, improperly printed documents with no assurance I have a complete copy. NOTE : I agreed to receive this letter but can not be certain that it will be accurate given the numerous inaccuracies to date. I prefer the resolution mentioned in the complaint summary. 


* I was told that Chase branch offices can not access the files although other Chase customer service representatives must have access to print out the documents, beginning with the person I spoke with at the end of XXXX and sent me the initial incomplete mailings. ( Contacting a branch was suggested by one of the other representatives with whom I have worked ) ** One of the customer service representatives did send me password protected .pdf files because after two - three attempts the documents were still not complete or improperly printed ( i.e., not sent, missing pages or printed so as not not provide the complete document on the page ).

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory XXXX XXXX Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 


3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 


4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit. 


5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 


6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory XXXX XXXX format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Incorrect information on your report,3

I have been disputing these charges for months and have also sent factual disputes for the discrepencies on each account. But XXXX insists on keeping it on my credit reports in order for someone to be resposible and pay. They have CHARGED OFF these accounts several times when I dispute them. Each account has been charged off 5-8 times. The accounts regularly updates even though it is charged off. They have negatively reaged the accounts changing deliquincy status of accounts to fool the credit bureaus into thinking it more recent. From my understanding, re-aging accounts is illegal and is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. When I dispute these accounts, the change the status to closed then later back to charged off. They have done this multiple times which negative affect my credit reports. XXXX  lists accounts closed and reports missed payments/change payment history, then removes missed payments, then changes back, which constantly negatively impacts my report. If accounts are charged off, how can a payment history be added. 
As of the recent dispute, they listed that they received a payment on each of the accounts which I have not made any payments on any of these accounts. Again, reaging the accounts on my credit reports. Isn't this illegal practicing?

Additional Context : On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a final demand letter to Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion Via CFPB.Gov formally requesting the immediate deletion of the disputed account due to the multiple inaccuracies and lack of validation. I gave them 7 calendar days to comply and warned of legal action if they failed to do so. To date ( XX/XX/XXXX ), no adequate response or correction has been made. This final demand letter represents my good faith effort to resolve this matter amicably before pursuing legal remedies. 

Furthermore, the account in question exhibits multiple discrepancies across the credit reports, including but not limited to : Duplicate Reporting : The same account is listed multiple times under same collection agency names ( different original creditors ), violating FCRA 607 ( b ) [ 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ], which mandates maximum possible accuracy. 

Conflicting Account Statuses and Dates : Variations in statuses and last activity dates indicate a lack of consistent reporting. 
Inconsistent Creditor/Collector Names : The account is associated with different entities, leading to confusion and misrepresentation. 

Contradictory Payment Histories : Discrepancies undermine the reliability of the data. 
Lack of Documentation : No legally binding agreement or contract has been provided to substantiate the debt, as required under FDCPA 809 [ 15 U.S.C. 1692g ].

Legal Violations and Supporting Case Law : The above failures constitute clear violations of federal law, including : FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) Failure to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation. 
XXXX XXXX TransUnion XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX Cir. XXXX ) : Credit bureaus must go beyond a cursory investigation and perform a reasonable reinvestigation.

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) : Reinforcing the need to remove unverifiable or disputed data. 
FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 7 ) Failure to provide the method of verification.

FCRA 607 ( b ) Duty to follow reasonable procedures for maximum possible accuracy.

15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) : "" If the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumers file at a consumer reporting agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency ... the agency shall, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate, unless it has reasonable grounds to believe that the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant, within 30 days from the date the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer ... '' Demand for Immediate Action : In light of these violations and the legal precedents supporting my claims, I demand the following actions within XXXX business days from the receipt of this letter : Permanent Deletion : Immediate removal of the disputed account from all credit reports. 
Written Confirmation : A formal letter confirming the deletion of the account. 
Failure to comply will result in immediate legal action filed in New York XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, seeking the following : Statutory Damages : Up to {$1000.00} per violation under FCRA 616 [ 15 U.S.C. 1681n ] and FDCPA 813 [ 15 U.S.C. 1692k ].

Actual Damages : For financial harm suffered.

Punitive Damages : For willful noncompliance.

Legal Costs : Including court and attorney fees. 
In addition, I will file formal complaints with the CFPB, FTC, and the New York State Attorney Generals Office. 

Too Late to Cure Deletion Required Under Law : As of XX/XX/XXXX, more than 30 days have passed since my dispute was received ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and acknowledged by all three credit bureaus, with no adequate response or verification provided. Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), the credit bureaus were required to complete a reinvestigation within 30 days. Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ), any information that can not be verified within that time must be deleted. Because the 30-day legal window has expired, it is now too late to cure, update, or modify this account. The law no longer permits correctiononly deletion is acceptable. I am formally demanding that this account be removed in its entirety from all credit files you maintain under my name. 

Supporting Documentation Statement : Attached are the following documents to support my identity, residency, and timeline of this dispute : - A copy of my state-issued identification to verify my identity. 
- A recent bank statement showing my name and address as proof of current residency. 
- A copy of my initial CFPB dispute filed on XX/XX/XXXX, which includes my formal request for reinvestigation, validation, and the method of verification. 
- A copy of my final demand dispute submitted via CFPB on XX/XX/XXXX, due to the credit bureaus ' failure to respond within the required 30-day timeframe as mandated by federal law. 

These documents further substantiate that I have followed all proper legal procedures in disputing the accuracy and validity of the account in question. The lack of response within the statutory window makes it legally impermissible for the bureaus to cure or update the informationonly full deletion is warranted at this point under FCRA 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ). 

This letter serves as a final opportunity to resolve the matter amicably before legal escalation.

1516060,"We have been trying to get a hold of Nationstar to assist us in foreclosure prevention. It has been most frustrating as everytime we call we are routed to the XXXX. We tried to reach the assigned dedicated specialist however he has not been available. The situation is that due to a severe hardship we fall behind, and when we called to get an amount to pay last month, we were told to pay approx {$27000.00}. Then a few weeks later it was approx $ 30K. Both a letter and the bank statement showed {$30000.00}. In addition when we spoke with one of the representative, XXXX XXXX, he advised that we continue to work on getting the amount in as soon as possible but try not to go over XX/XX/XXXX, as at the point it could go over to the attorney to set a date. Prior to it going to the attorneys, they could accept that amount. We have been calling since last week, and each time we called we received a different amount to pay. Yesterday after speaking with several representatives that are working out of the XXXX, we received different information, then when transferred to the US reps, we received still different information, and we were advised to call the attorney 's office - XXXX. We called the attorney 's office and Spoke with XXXX, she advised that she could not give us any amounts as that would have to come from Nationstar. It seems as if they are playing games as we are getting close to them setting the date of the sale. 

Since we were not getting any replies from anyone at Nationstar, we sent a payment of {$30000.00} based on the last statement showing {$30000.00} because we do not want our home to be foreclosed. The amount has now been received as I called the bank and the payment was confirmed, however, it is in a suspense account so it is still showing our account outstanding for the payments. This is most disturbing as the payment amount makes our payments current to XX/XX/XXXX with approx. another {$1400.00} extra. We believe they are taking advantage of the situation to set a sale and charge more money as they are now charging us {$37000.00}. Again, when we called the attorney 's office we were advised that publication of the XXXX had not been ordered by Nationstar as of yet and this was Yesterday XX/XX/XXXX. Today we were also advised that there was no sale date. Yet we are receiving notices that a XXXX/XXXX/15 sale date was set by Nationstar. 
In the past we have had issues with how they calculated insurance, a few times when we actually had insurance they force placed a policy and charged us over {$4000.00} for the year. In addition, our taxes were miscalculated and ended up paying more for our monthly mortgage payment. We did call them but it was not an easy or quick resolution. SO this latest stint of having them route us to representatives using Dialers where they ca n't transfer us per some agents to US Representatives is just a travesty when we are dealing with a very serious situation. Even when we told one of the representatives that we were going to file a complaint for their mistreatment of our account, she merely said, '' Ok, it is your choice ''. We do n't believe that having people who do n't care or understand the seriousness of these situations should be allowed to handle these types of accounts. We are not deadbeats as the bank makes us out to be. We too were victims of the dreadful recession which caused my company to transfer out of XXXX to XXXX. The dedicated specialists we had in the past were very helpful, however as of late, it has been very frustrating not being able to speak with someone with authority.",Mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",1

We filed another modification packet, send it via Priority mail with proof of delivery, it is received by HSBC but they only uploaded part of the package they did not know where the rest of the packet was "" THEY LOST THE MODIFICATION PACKET I MAILED IN '', so I need to resend the packet so this time the case manager gives me her email, I email all XXXX pages. By now I am speaking with the case mananger daily who is telling me they have everything I should have an answer soon. Two weeks go by I get a letter in the mail they are missing paperwork I sent directly to the case manager 's via email two weeks ago. The case manager is out sick at least once a week, she goes out on vacation, etc. this goes on for 6 months, always missing some paperwork or 30 days have gone by and need to submit new paperwork. I requested to speak with her manager and initially this new manager tells me she will handle, with her I finally get a confirmation that they have a completed packet, this is about 6/7 months after I started again in 2014. Since I know this packet is only good for 30 days I am on the phone every day asking making sure no other paperwork is required and I will get a decision. On day XXXX when I call in they tell me they are missing a updated form and that unfortunately I will need to resubmit, INCREDIBLE! I am beginning to fall ill due to the stress and the inefficiencies with this company, two more months go by I get the manager 's supervisor, top person in Modification to listen to my concerns and she steps in to help ... couple more months go by but at least she is a bit more responsive. New packet requested and is sent via email to both supervisors, case manager and general HSBC modification email after 28 days I got a call today after calling multiple times that the modification was DENIED because the principal & interest is greater than debt, do n't even know what that means but I just feel they have just denied it to avoid working out a solution, we qualify under the financial parameters, HSBC is deliberately doing this to take our home away. They have put up every barrier they need to make sure they do not provide a loan modification.

The title and escrow was handled by Title Security Agency of Arizona. I was extremely surprised that no appraisal was conducted, but we thought the house was a good deal. Once we began making mortgage payments we were surprised that the company that collected the mortgage payments was also Title Security Agency of Arizona. Additionally they disbursed the property taxes and insurance from our escrow account. I felt at that time there may be some type of conflict of interest here. In XX/XX/XXXX I was laid off from my job working on the XXXX due to the XXXX. I had some money saved and was able to make the payments for several months while I tried to find new work but eventually the money ran out and I defaulted on the loan. I immediately reached out to XXXX XXXX to tell him what had happened and see if anything could be worked out in relation to the loan. He was non-responsive. I missed a couple more payments and was then contacted by XXXX Attorney XXXX XXXX. He demanded full reinstatement of the late payments, along with some exorbitant and questionable late fees and legal fees. By this time I had found work again as a XXXX and was able to resume making regular payments and tried to get XXXX XXXX to work with me. Once again, I was obstructed by XXXX XXXX, who stated that all communication must go through him. He told me there were no options other than full reinstatement. 

I am now facing a foreclosure sale date.

I began looking into the loan and the situation and I have some serious concerns. 

As I recall XXXX XXXX served as the realtor on this loan as well as the owner of the property and the mortgage lender. I believe that may be a problem relating to his fiduciary responsibility to me as the buyer of the home. His preferred title company, Title Security Agency handled the title and escrow for the loan and are now also servicing this same loan. I believe there are serious conflict of interest issues here. I also believe that there may be RESPA violations relating to kickbacks and referrals of business that I feel should be investigated. I also believe that XXXX XXXX and his Attorney XXXX XXXX have violated Arizona foreclosure protocol, by denying me access to ANY POSSIBLE OPTIONS to retain my home, or offering the possibility of mediation. I believe there are serious concerns with the business practices of the parties involved in this loan and am filing this complaint to alert your organization to take a deeper look.

After her passing, our family discovered an XXXX XXXX XXXX banking account that Grandma owned, which no one in the family had previously known about. My Aunt, Grandma 's primary caretaker, received an XXXX Statement for XX/XX/XXXX showing a monthly mortgage deduction of {$2300.00} from the XXXX  Account to a Wells Fargo Mortgage Account. Grandma 's name is not on or associated with the Mortgage account and Grandma never had any mortgage products with Wells Fargo, which was confirmed on XX/XX/XXXX by Wells Fargo Branch Manager XXXX XXXX who wrote a letter to that effect. It is my understanding these deductions began around XX/XX/XXXX, roughly 17 months after my Grandma entered her XXXX XXXX XXXX and have continued ever since totaling losses of {$40000.00} at this time. XXXX confirmed that the ACH was initiated at Wells Fargo and I was able to obtain ACH Trace # XXXX and Pay ID XXXX associated with the ACH deduction. 

I contacted Wells Fargo with case # XXXX and worked with XXXX XXXX as my case manager with a request to investigate any potential banking error that may have led to this mortgage withdraw, to stop the monthly ACH deduction, and return unauthorized funds that were paid from my Grandma 's XXXX  account to this unassociated mortgage at Wells Fargo. XXXX contacted me last week to inform me that the ACH would not be stopped. I am not authorized on this mortgage account ( which I will refer to as XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX mortgage account ), nor was my Grandma authorized for changes/access to XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX mortgage account, and only the account holder or their personal representative can authorize stop payment of the ACH. I was informed that due to consumer privacy laws, Wells Fargo could not share the signed authorization form for consent to withdraw funds from the XXXX Account with me, nor could any other information be provided to track down XXXX XXXX or the property attached to XXXX XXXX XXXX mortgage for which my Grandma has now paid {$40000.00} and continues to be charged monthly. The XXXX account now has a negative balance after the XX/XX/XXXX ACH withdraw came out and will continue to deplete further, while also accruing negative account fees, as future withdraws continue on a monthly basis. 

I asked if any further investigation would or could continue internally at Wells Fargo regarding this fraud and missing funds. I understand that legally information regarding XXXX XXXX and the mortgage can not be shared with me personally, but since no banking error has been determined at either Wells Fargo or XXXX, this leaves fraud and/or identity theft as the only viable conclusions regarding these mortgage payments. I was told no future or further investigation would occur at Wells Fargo. I asked if I could escalate this issue to a higher internal investigation body at Wells Fargo and I was told that this case was already at the highest office of investigation. We are heading to probate and I asked if the Personal Representative paperwork for my Grandmas Estate would help us make any progress in this issue. I was told it would not, since Grandma was not listed as an authorized person on XXXX XXXX account. 

As previously stated, my Grandma is also deceased as of XX/XX/XXXX. Wells Fargo was notified of my Grandmas passing with her death certificate presented in XX/XX/XXXX to Wells Fargo when we closed her active accounts at the institution, which included 1 Checking, 2 Savings, 1 Line of Credit and 1 Credit Card Account. There were/are no other active accounts in Grandmas name at Wells Fargo .

I have also opened a police report with XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX Police Department case number XXXX With all this background information in mind, my complaint/request is as follows : 1. Why has the ACH which was initiated on Wells Fargos side not been stopped, even though notice of my Grandmothers death has been provided. Does this signed agreement end at death? If so, why is it still active? 

2. I would like the ACH to be stopped to prevent my Grandmas XXXX Account from going further into the negative. 

3. I would like Wells Fargo to further investigate the fraud and/or identity theft occurring to my Grandma from XXXX XXXX mortgage account since they are the only entity with visibility to XXXXXXXX XXXX  account information and history. I would assume if this individual is committing fraud and/or identity theft against my Grandma, they are likely to have other victims as well. 

4. I would like full reimbursement of any previous funds paid to the mortgage account from my Grandmas XXXX account. Currently the known amount is just over {$40000.00}, but there XXXX be other transactions associated with this mortgage or fraud that are unknown to me at this time. 

5. I would like any fees associated with the negative balance on my Grandmas XXXX XXXX XXXX account reimbursed in full 6. Based on the evidence provided and the conclusions of the internal case investigation at Wells Fargo showing no banking error and no association with my Grandma to XXXXXXXX XXXX or his/her mortgage, along with the ACH agreement likely containing standard language that the agreement ends at death, Wells Fargo is knowingly and willingly aiding and abetting fraud and/or identity theft at their institution by refusing to investigate this issue further or be helpful in any way to tracking down the criminal engaging in these activities. 

I have attached the following documents to this complaint : 1. XXXX XXXX for XX/XX/XXXX - front & back 2. Letter from Wells Fargo Branch Manager XXXX XXXX confirming no mortgage accounts have ever been opened by my Grandma at Wells Fargo 3. A small claims affidavit demonstrating that I am the next of kin I did not attach, but I do have, Grandmas Death Certificate.

Due to the lack of communication and statements from Nationstar, I stopped sending payments as I had no idea where these payments were going or if they were even being applied to my account.

I have endured extraordinary hardship and have slowly rebuilt my life and situation. However, Caliber has refused to open a review of my current financial situation, has not assigned a case manager or dedicated contact and has told me the only options is to short sale or reinstate the loan in full, which is not possible. I do n't understand how they can refuse to even CONSIDER working with me or helping me or looking at my current financial situation, which has changed considerably since my last review. They received millions in bailout dollars, I thought they were supposed to look at my information and give me a chance. 

I refinanced into this loan in 2007. A little over a year later when my wife turned XXXX she decided to take off and go on the road as a XXXX, abandoning me and the kids. XXXX. There were long periods of unexplained absences and several months later I had divorce papers drafted. XXXX At that time I had been taking care of the kids and making the mortgage payment since she had deserted us six months earlier. However the police came and we went to court. I could not afford an Attorney and my wife was granted XXXX as well as control of the house. I was forced to leave the house and my kids and had to move into an apartment. My employer found out about the XXXX and I lost my job as well. I eventually found a job XXXX and had to XXXX in my spare time to sell it in order to keep myself fed. I obviously was not in a position to make the mortgage payment. 

During that time my wife never made the mortgage payment, and let the house, the lawn and the pool go.

I found out about this after the fact, I did not see the paperwork until the offer had expired and I suspect that my ex wife who was still lurking around at that time had something to do with that. 

I have tried since then to re-engage with Caliber and have not made any progress. My business and income have continually increased and now my son who lives in the house is working as well and contributing his share.

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act has been established by Congress, your agency 's role to me the principal, A consumer, is to adopt reasonable procedures to uphold the need to ensure that your grave responsibilities fairness, impartiality, and respect for my right to privacy must be maintained for maximum accuracy. Under 15 U.S. Code 1681e et seq, you may not procure or furnish a consumer report without following 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ) as my written instructions. There has been a violation of these reasonable procedures because as I showed within my attachments there has been inaccurate and unverifiable information removed from another consumer reporting agency and has not been removed from your system. You should be aware your failure to maintain your reasonable procedures for maximum accuracy has resulted in a conspiracy that deprived me of my right under the Truth in Lending Act subsection 1602 ( f ) to extend new credit for me. This deprivation of my rights is a federal criminal violation under 18 U.S. Code 241.

6396965,"In response to the SPS replies of late, 1. "" SPS is a mortgage servicer '' does not say that SPS is or ever was "" servicing '' my alleged unpaid loan account. This is an obvious attempt to avoid making the assertion that they should be making and instead replacing it with an implication. Their response implies that they have been servicing your payments and making distributions to your creditor. If that is not true, then their statement is irrelevant. 
2. I object to the assertion that SPS is the company that performs any functions with respect to physical receipt, processing, depositing or disbursement of funds in relation to any account bearing my name or any unpaid loan account on the ledger of any creditor. And they don't say that they do represent such a creditor or that they do perform such functions. If they mean they do other things that technically complies with the definition of "" Servicer '' then they should say what they mean or not say it at all, since that is irrelevant to the question of validation of the debt. 
3. "" servicing of your account was transferred to SPS from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX ''. They do not state that XXXX was performing the aforesaid functions of a servicer either. AND it fails to respond to my question or request for documents, to wit : if the servicing was transferred this "" misunderstanding '' could be cleared up potentially by presenting the agreement between XXXX and SPS. Under representations and warranties, the issues would be clearly stated as is required in all documents involving banks. Neither of them assert that they represent as agent any creditor who maintains an unpaid account due from me. 
4. "" SPS services the account according to the terms of the enclosed Note and Deed of Trust that were signed at origination. '' This is untrue unless they are willing to assert that they are in the business of accreting payments from me and that they have received payments from me and deposited those payments to the benefit of a creditor or otherwise distributed the funds for the benefit of a creditor. 
5. "" we have also enclosed your Home Affordable Modification Agreement, SPS Transaction History, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Account Activity Statement, Corporate Advance History, Escrow Disbursement History, and Fee History. '' This is not relevant without an assertion and corroboration of the existence of an unpaid receivable account owed to some identified creditor who will acknowledge both the debt owned by them and their appointment of XXXX or SPS as their agent. A copy of the ledger certified by the alleged creditor is what I am asking for, not some random report run by remote financial technology companies. 
6. "" Please understand that servicing rights and duties are established by contract between the Noteholder and the servicer. '' This is only true if the noteholder is the owner of the underlying debt. The servicing contract has not been produced. Normal servicing contracts would have the principal ( creditor ) warrant ownership and authority over the asset that is being managed by the servicer. 
7. "" As the servicer, SPS is responsible for enforcing the Deed of Trust and Note on behalf of the Noteholder. '' This statement is untrue. It is not responsible nor even authorized to enforce unless selected and appointed to do so by an identified creditor who affirms ownership of the debt and the appointment of SPS to enforce it. This is exactly what I have been asking to receive and they keep evading the question. 
XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  successor trustee to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, successor in interest to XXXX XXXX XXXX as trustee, on behalf of the holders of the Washington XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is the Noteholder of the account, and SPS is the mortgage servicer. '' SPS can not be the mortgage servicer, unless it is acting as the agent of a creditor who can produce an authorized officer or employee to affirm the ownership of a debt owed by me to that creditor. XXXX XXXX is not the successor trustee to XXXX XXXX XXXX, unless it was authorized to do so by the party who created the trust, along with the consent of the beneficiaries of the trust. The trust agreement in which XXXXXXXX XXXX was originally named, can not possibly qualify XXXX XXXX as a successor trustee under the terms of the trust agreement. My argument with this is that, regardless of whether or not the trustor agreed to the change of trustee, and regardless of whether or not this change could've been ratified by the beneficiaries, no such agreement or consent was ever given. ThereforeXXXX XXXX XXXX has no right to be operating as the trustee for the alleged trust. ( which doesn't own the debt anyway ). Since neither the trust agreement for this particular trust, nor any evidence of consent or authorization by the trust, or beneficiaries, is even referenced, this statement is pure nonsense designed to provoke the reader into implying or inferring that these formalities have been satisfied. Remember that the trust itself, even if it exists, it's just a legal fiction based on following the formalities required by statute. Lastly, the reference is not to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  or even XXXX XXXX being a trustee for a trust. it is an assertion that they are trustees or agents for certificate holders. Once again the attempt is to provoke the reader into implying or inferring that the certificate holders are beneficiaries. But without any doubt that the certificate holders are not beneficiaries of any trust. XXXXXXXX XXXX owes no fiduciary duty to any certificate holder and in litigation, XXXX XXXX has repeatedly and successfully defended against lawsuits filed by certificate holders asserting that XXXX XXXX  owed any duty to them. 
9. "" While there is no recorded assignment to provide to you at this time, the mortgage assignment is tracked through the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems ( MERS ) electronic registry. MERS tracks the ownership and servicing of some mortgage loans in the United States. '' The statement is not only untrue, it is blatantly fraudulent. There is no recorded assignment because the XXXX was never purchased, sold, or even assigned on paper. This grows out of false claims that XXXX XXXX  has mostly abandoned. When it acquired the assets of XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX illegally took the position in courts across the country that every loan that had been originated by XXXX XXXX, was owned by XXXX, even though those loans were all subject to claims of securitization just like my transaction.

I formally requested an itemized list of charges and receipts from the apartment complex in XXXX and again in XXXX to verify the validity of this debt.

I have disputed this account multiple times with XXXX, yet they continue to report it, despite the lack of supporting documentation from the original creditor.

3767820,"As the result of a single button-press in their XXXX app to receive more information, Wells Fargo enrolled me in a forbearance program for my home equity line of credit. 

I pushed a button in their XXXX app to learn more about payment assistance for my home equity line of creditseemed like a good idea given the uncertainties at the time. Next thing I know, I received a number of letters in the mail stating that they had approved a forbearance and that they were suspending my ability to draw on the remaining {$60000.00} available credit in my account. I did not skip any payments ( in fact, I made a {$5000.00} principal payment just after pushing the button ), and have a flawless record of on-time payments on this and all of my other accounts over my entire adult lifetime ( XXXX years ). My credit rating is PERFECT. 

I immediately phoned WF and spent weeks talking to more than 10 different people. Several of the people agreed to cancel the forbearance and restore my ability to make withdrawals, but in the end the forbearance was cancelled before it went into effect ( good ) but they said I would have to submit my two most recent income tax returns and re-qualify for the full line of credit before my draws could be reinstated ( not good ). I also asked WF to reverse the {$5000.00} payment I had just made. They did not refuse but kept stalling me until it was too late. According to WF, because I applied for a forbearance ( I merely wanted more details ), that indicates that Im having financial problems ( Im not ), and they dont want me to get further in debt. How someone with their assumed "" financial problems '' can make a {$5000.00} principal payment I don't know. Im lucky, I have other assets I can draw on. But someone who doesnt have other assets and was negatively affected by the current COVID-19 crisis would almost certainly be forced into foreclosure were their access to {$60000.00} of available credit to suddenly disappear. Perhaps thats the goal. In my case, Wells Fargo could take possession of a $ XXXX house for $ XXXX and keep the difference. Seems like a tidy profit opportunity to me. 

Adding insult to injury, my credit report still reflects {$180000.00} in available credit for this loan, even though Im locked out of $ XXXX of it. This essentially prevents me from obtaining a smaller line of credit to replace the frozen {$60000.00}. Whats more, as I pay down the balance, the amount of available '' credit ( which is actually frozen ) will continue to rise, so my borrowing ability will likely be hindered for the next 20 years or until the HELOC is paid off.",Mortgage,Trouble during payment process,1
14742461,"To Whom It May Concern : This letter is a formal dispute regarding the major inconsistencies found in the reporting of my XXXX XXXX XXXX credit account. The information presented on my credit report is contradictory and demonstrates inaccurate reporting by the data furnisher ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and the consumer reporting agencies. 
Key Findings and Discrepancies * Contradictory Account Status : Open vs. Charged Off * The current details of my account ( Image XXXX ) present it as open and active. It shows a current balance of {$63.00}, a credit limit of {$1200.00}, and recent payment history for XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. The primary alert states, "" You have missed a payment on this account. '' * However, a recent change to my report ( Image XXXX ) explicitly states that between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, a remark for "" Charged off account '' was removed. 
* Discrepancy : These XXXX statuses are mutually exclusive. An account can not be both open and actively reporting monthly payments while also being "" charged off. '' The fact that my account was reported as charged off just days ago is in direct conflict with its current presentation as an open, active account. This strongly suggests that the reporting is fundamentally inaccurate. 
* Inaccurate Reporting Following My Consumer Dispute * My credit report shows that a remark was recently added to the account : "" Consumer disputes- reinvestigation in progress '' ( Image XXXX ). This is correct, as I did initiate a dispute. 
* Following my dispute, the "" Charged off account '' remark was removed ( Image XXXX ). 
* Analysis : While a change was made as a result of my dispute, the outcome is still inaccurate. Instead of correcting the account to show a {$0.00} balance and closed status or deleting the account entirely, it has been modified to appear as a standard open account with simple delinquencies. The underlying negative information remains, but in a new, equally confusing and inaccurate context. 
* Violation of "" Maximum Possible Accuracy '' * The FCRA requires that CRAs follow "" reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy '' of the information in reports. 
* The combination of conflicting information ( open vs. charged off ), the confusing changes made after my dispute, and the remaining delinquencies creates a misleading picture of my account 's actual status and history. An account that was severe enough to be charged off should not suddenly appear as a standard open account with a couple of late payments. This reporting fails the standard of maximum possible accuracy. 
* Potential Mathematical Inaccuracy in Payment History * The account details ( Image XXXX ) state, "" You've made 75 % of payments on time. '' * My account was opened in XX/XX/XXXX, which is a XXXX period. The visible history for XXXX shows XXXX on-time payments and XXXX missed payments. 
* To achieve 75 % on-time payments over XXXX  months, I would need approximately 6.75 on-time payments ( XXXX \times 0.75 ). Even if my first XXXX payments were on time, that would be XXXX on-time payments out of XXXX total, which is 77.8\ %. If only XXXX of the first XXXX were on time, that would be XXXX out of XXXX, or 66.7\ %. The 75 % figure appears arbitrary and is another example of inaccurate data being reported on my account. 
Legal Framework : My Rights Under The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) My rights in this situation are protected by the FCRA. The key provisions are : * 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( FCRA 611 ) : This grants me the right to dispute inaccurate information on my credit report. The CRA must then conduct a "" reasonable reinvestigation '' within 30 days.

* 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ) ( FCRA 623 ) : This places duties on the furnisher of the information ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ). Once notified of my dispute by a CRA, they must conduct their own investigation. If they find the information is inaccurate, incomplete, or can not be verified, they must notify all CRAs to which they reported to permanently delete or modify the information.",Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,1

I am writing to humbly request your assistance regarding a financial hardship that occurred during the nationally declared disaster in XXXX, which I addressed with XXXX. My intention is to seek your understanding and compassion in addressing a 30-day late payment that has continued to cause a significant financial burden. 

During the declared disaster in XXXX, our household was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Several members of my family, including myself, XXXX XXXX XXXX, which led to an inability to work and maintain regular income. As a result, despite our consistent efforts to manage our finances responsibly, we fell behind on one bill payment during this challenging time. 

The 30-day late payment, which occurred during this period of extreme hardship, was an isolated incident in an otherwise impeccable payment history. The account in question has since been paid off, and I have continued to uphold responsible credit practices.

On XX/XX/XXXX I sent 96 pages by fax to XXXX XXXX from a local chase branch with proof of payments. I have a receipt for that fax. 
They never responded. My son, wrote a letter to them in XX/XX/XXXX outlining our dispute for payments not credited in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. 
I have sent them proof of missed credit for payments and excessive escrow charges to my mortgage account from their payment history which they told CFPB they had submitted to me as a resolution for the problem. The problem has never been solved. XXXX XXXX and now SPS who bought the servicing contract on my loan, has never addressed the proof of payments that I have submitted to them. 
The payment history from XXXX which they sent to me, clearly shows excessive capitalization to my mortgage account of {$170000.00} since XX/XX/XXXX. 
In reconciling these charges, I have discovered that the amount of {$100000.00} is owed to my mortgage account since XX/XX/XXXX which has not been credited. 
As stated above I sent 96 pages by fax from a local XXXX branch to them in XX/XX/XXXX which XXXX and now SPS has never acknowledged. 
They have never acknowledged receipt of this proof of payments to substantiate my claim. 
Therefore I am requesting a complete review of my account which includes crediting the payments I have submitted and acknowledging the excessive escrow charges made to my account which is shown on the XXXX payment transaction hiostory. 
I submitted a prior complaint to the Consumer Finance Protection Board on XX/XX/XXXX and the complaint number is # XXXX which you stated the company has submitted a reply but this reply is not correct or acceptable to me. 

They may have responded to my complaint to your agency dated XX/XX/XXXX. But they did not address the problems of the missed payment credits nor the excessive accrued interest payments and escrow charges made to my mortgage account as evidenced by the XXXX Transaction payment history and the proof of payments I sent to them in XX/XX/XXXX. 

Lately SPS sent me a Cancellation of Debt Notice for {$210000.00} dated XX/XX/XXXX but according to the SPS payment history they only excused {$71000.00} from the Deferred Interest Balance. 
The notice they sent to me or {$210000.00} is erroneous and I have sent them many letters requesting that they sent a corrected statement which they have not done. 
This notice has tax implications and the amount stated on it is not correct and it must be corrected.

Description of the Problem : I am filing this complaint against Discover Financial Services for unfair and deceptive credit reporting practices. The company is reporting a debt on my credit file, even though they no longer own the account.

Under FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ), furnishers of credit information must report only accurate and complete information. If Discover has sold, transferred, or assigned the debt, they no longer have the legal right to report it as an outstanding obligation under their name. 

Additionally, under FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692e ( 8 ) ), misrepresenting the legal status of a debt is a deceptive practice and a clear violation of federal law. 

Since XXXX, I sent a formal dispute letter to Discover requesting debt validation and proof of ownership. However, they have failed to provide sufficient documentation proving that they own the debt or have the authority to report it. 
I have proof they received payment and the balance was zeroed out and requested a payoff letter. 
Despite my dispute, Discover continues to furnish inaccurate and misleading information to credit reporting agencies, which is damaging my credit and causing financial harm. 

Resolution Requested : 1. Immediate removal of the inaccurate debt from all credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ) if Discover can not provide verifiable proof of ownership.

2. Correction of all misreported account information per FCRA and FDCPA guidelines. 


3. Monetary compensation for damages caused by Discovers false reporting, including loss of credit opportunities.

Though the home I own is on five acres, in the process of acquiring this loan on my home, I was goaded into providing an additional parcel of land of another five acres. This additional land is a separate tax entity and is not included in the tax payment on my land. Regardless the loan documents were drawn up to include 10 acres. Taxes are always paid as a separate entity. The appraiser appraised my home and verbally told me the appraisal was {$370000.00}, an appropriate amount of the reverse mortgage was never funded, and the additional amount of land Wells Fargo would own was tacked on later.

I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect XXXX XXXX format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, XXXX XXXX statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. 

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the XXXX, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified XXXX XXXX compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory XXXX XXXX Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s )  and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory XXXX XXXX format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff XXXX s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and  responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Incorrect information on your report,3

Violations Committed : Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Violations : Under 15 U.S. Code 1666b, creditors must send periodic statements at least 21 days before the payment due date. The continued reporting of this inaccurate late payment demonstrates a failure to comply with this requirement. 
15 U.S. Code 1681i mandates that credit reporting agencies ensure the accuracy of consumer credit files. In my case, this obligation has not been upheld. 
15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) requires that consumer reporting agencies maintain reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy in credit reports.

15 U.S. Code 1681a ( d ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( i ) states that certain transactions and experiences should not be considered part of a consumer report if they do not meet specific criteria. 
Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) Violations : The TILA emphasizes the necessity of accurate and timely disclosures to consumers. The wrongful reporting of a late payment has damaged my creditworthiness, causing undue financial harm. 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ) Violations : 15 U.S. Code 6801, 15 U.S. Code 6802, and 15 U.S. Code 6803 require financial institutions to protect consumer privacy and ensure the accuracy of financial reporting. The mishandling of my credit information suggests a failure to meet these obligations. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX of Obligations XXXX ( XXXX ) : This act holds creditors accountable for providing timely statements and preventing unfair penalties. The continued presence of this late payment on my report contradicts this protection. 
XXXX XXXX and XXXX - 18 U.S. Code 1028A : The continued reporting of false information could be classified as a misrepresentation of identity or fraudulent reporting, which carries legal consequences under federal law. 
Formal Request for Correction : I formally demand the immediate removal of the inaccurate late payment notation from my credit report. 
If this issue is not resolved immediately, I will escalate my complaint further, including potential legal action and filing additional complaints with relevant agencies. 
Reference to XXXX ( Paid As Agreed Never Late ) : The terms of our agreement have always been met, and the account in question must reflect the status of "" Paid As Agreed, Never Late. '' I request documented proof supporting the claim of late payments, including : Dates, amounts, and all communication records indicating that the payments were actually late. 
In the absence of valid proof, I expect an immediate correction of my credit report. 
If, after investigation, you fail to provide verifiable proof of late payments, I demand that the account be updated immediately to reflect its accurate status as "" Paid As Agreed, Never Late. '' Per the FCRA, I expect a timely investigation and a written response within 30 days from the receipt of this dispute letter. Failure to comply will be considered a direct violation of multiple federal laws. 

Discrepancies Identified : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  reports a XXXX late payment for XX/XX/XXXX, while TransUnion and XXXX both report the account as "" OK '' ( on time ) for the same period. 


This inconsistency shows the late mark is unreliable and unverifiable. 


Account XXXX and Remarks The account is reported as "" Closed '' and "" Paid '' by all three bureaus with a {$0.00} balance, contradicting any ongoing delinquency. 


XXXX  states : Account previously in dispute- now resolved by data furnisher, which further casts doubt on the accuracy of the late payment reported. 


No Valid Reason for Delinquency With the account marked as paid and closed in XX/XX/XXXX, the reported late payments for XXXX and XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX are illogical and should not exist post-closure. 
XXXX Requested : XXXX removal of the late payment notation from my credit report. 
Written confirmation of the correction. 
Acknowledgment of compliance with federal laws.

Details of the Complaint : 1. Lack of Proper Notification & Debt Validation On XX/XX/year>, XXXX XXXX claims to have sent me an email regarding this alleged debt. This was their only attempt to notify me before reporting the debt to the credit bureaus. 
Under FDCPA 15 U.S.C. 1692g, a debt collector must provide written notice of a debt within five days of initial communication. No such written notice was ever received.

2. Failure to Provide Debt Validation Upon Request On XX/XX/year>, I received a phone call from a representative of FirstCredit Services, during which I first became aware of this alleged debt. 
I immediately requested a validation letter, yet the company has failed to provide any documentation proving the validity of the debt or their authority to collect it. 
This is a clear violation of my rights under the FDCPA, which requires debt collectors to cease collection efforts until proper validation is provided.

3. Unlawful Reporting to Credit Bureaus Despite failing to provide debt validation, FirstCredit Services reported this account to the credit bureaus, resulting in a derogatory mark on my credit report.

Under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ), information furnished to credit reporting agencies must be accurate and verifiable. Reporting a debt without first validating it is a violation of the FCRA and constitutes unfair and deceptive practices.",Debt collection,Written notification about debt,1

2921860,"I am the executrix of my deceased parents estate. I use the term estate begrudgingly. As I was left a monumental disaster to deal with. I am still in the process of dealing with this mess. My parents had no life insurance policies, no savings, no retirement. They only had debts, and I have spent thousands of dollars of my own money dealing with this mess. Ive spent thousands on dumpsters clearing refuse out of their house so I can someday put it on the market to be sold, this is an ongoing process. I am not there yet. This estate has placed me in financial distress. But I am trying my best to deal with it. 

But in the meantime creditors have put liens on the property, which is understandable, as this estate is ongoing and there is no money to pay these debts at this point. But they will be settled when the property is eventually sold. 

Except the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and their solicitor, XXXX XXXX XXXX, who have chosen to pursue a debt of an unpaid sewer bill with me personally, the executrix, instead of placing a lien on the property of my parents. 

First of all, my mother died two years ago, in the subsequent two years they have never sent a bill or attempted to collect any money from me or the estate. They claimed to have sent bills, which is a blatant lie, as I check my mail everyday and would have paid the quarterly bill due. Instead they have chosen to wait until the amount is large enough that I or the estate can not afford to pay it. I did offer to make payments to a nice gentleman, named XXXX. His last name escapes me. XXXX refused to accept the payments that I was able to make and instead threatened to put a lien on my parents property. I told him he was free to do so. Apparently that wasnt enough for XXXX, he likes to harass the families of deceased people and threaten to ruin their credit and place them in dire financial situations over a bill that was never theirs. 

My name is not on the account associated with this sanitary authority, it is not my bill personally and it is not my account nor is it my property! The home, therefore the subsequent debts, do not belong to me personally. Yet, I am being harassed and threatened by the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and their lawyer. They refer to the debt as your past due sewer account. That is a blatant misrepresentation of the facts. This has never been my sewer account. I dont even know the account number. Then they go on to threaten legal action against me personally if the amount of {$780.00} isnt paid in full within 30 days. Im not sure why they would harass me and threaten to sue me when they can just put a lien on the property, which ensures they receive payment when the estate is settled. This is abusive. Then they proceed to threaten to seize my property and place a judgment against me. I do not have the ability to appear in court. I do not even reside in the same state where my parents owe this debt. I live hundreds of miles away.

9749055,"Dear CFPB, I am writing to formally lodge a complaint against Freedom Mortgage regarding a serious issue with the creation of an escrow account without my knowledge, which has led to the improper distribution of tax dollars and an unjust doubling of my mortgage payments. 

Background : I recently discovered that Freedom Mortgage incorrectly established an escrow account for my property taxes in XXXX XXXX. Despite my property taxes being fully paid and not overdue, Freedom Mortgage has disbursed tax dollars from this account for taxes I did not owe. This mistake has had significant financial repercussions for me. 

Specific Issues : Incorrect Escrow Account Setup : Freedom Mortgage initiated an escrow account without verifying the accuracy of the tax information. As a result, they have erroneously collected and distributed funds for taxes that were not owed on my property. 

Increased Mortgage Payments : Due to the incorrect setup of the escrow account, my mortgage payments have been unfairly doubled. This increase is directly related to the mismanagement of the escrow account and the improper disbursement of funds. 

Actions Taken : I have attempted to resolve this issue directly with Freedom Mortgage, but their responses have been inadequate. They have not provided a satisfactory resolution or corrected the errors in their records, despite my numerous attempts to rectify the situation. 

Request for CFPB Assistance : I kindly request that the CFPB investigate this matter and take appropriate action to ensure that : The incorrect escrow account setup is corrected. 
The erroneous payments made from the escrow account are reimbursed to me. 
My mortgage payments are adjusted to reflect the correct amount, eliminating any undue increase caused by this error. 
I am including copies of all relevant documents, including correspondence with Freedom Mortgage, statements showing the incorrect escrow setup, and evidence of the undue increase in my mortgage payments.

I have been paying PMI since the loan originated, but last year applied to have PMI removed. I paid their fee for their appraiser to come out and appraise the current value of my home. Their appraiser stated the value at just under the value that was needed to remove PMI on the loan.

In XX/XX/2018, I had another appraisal done to try to refinance the house. The appraised value came in higher than the value needed too remove PMI last year, so, once the refinance failed ( due to a separate issue with divorce ) I contacted PHH/mortgagequestions.com to start the process to remove PMI from the stated value from the appraisal. I have contacted them several times. More than 1 week after each contact ( their autoresponder to email states I'll get a response in 24 hours ), I get a response to my request that they will send out a letter outlining requirements within 7-10 days. I've been trying for a month now and I have not gotten this letter, nor have they responded with a reason as to why they're delaying responses.

Their delay in removing PMI and their appraisal last year feels deliberate in an attempt for them to continue collecting that fee even in light of the requirements for removing its having been met.

Additionally, I have my mortgage payments set for 2 equal payments each month.

2372182,"I applied for modification due to my interest-only loan becoming fully amortizing and interest rate increasing which resulted in an unaffordable payment. This complaint is due to Nationstar 's determined income being significantly beyond our available income and ability to repay. It appears their model for determining income does not support QM or ATR requirements. 
Nationstar uses a gross income average from XXXX paystubs and annualizes this income as stable qualifying income. This is without regard to the source of income. In our circumstance, their method of determination significantly overstated both my spouse 's and my incomes. Their approach negligently disregards the continuance of all income sources and is not in agreement with both QM and ATR requirements. 
For example, my income determination used overtime that was not supported with YTD earnings. It was not considered if this income was supported or expected to continue. My modification application intentionally excluded overtime as monthly income since this was not stable or expected to continue. Per the documentation provided, my most recent paystubs have bi-weekly overtime of {$1200.00} and {$1300.00}. Nationstar calculated total gross income as an average of {$4300.00}, annualized to $ XXXX = or {$9500.00} mo. Considering base income per paystub of $ XXXX {$6600.00}, Nationstar considered {$2800.00} as stable overtime income for qualification. Check ending date of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and pay ending date of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX does not support this as stable income. YTD overtime average per last paystub is {$1300.00} monthly ( {$11000.00} XXXX ). This evidences that this is potentially not a stable income source and would require additional analysis for consideration. In reality, this overtime is not stable and resulted from significant mortgage volume resulting from the lowest interest rates in history ( XXXX XXXX ). Any significant overtime is not currently or expected to be available. Overtime at this amount was not supported by the XXXX XXXX or YTD income. This is why this income was not included on the modification application. In summary total income was determined at {$120000.00} ( Annual bonus plus Nationstar determined income ) rather than base salary of {$79000.00} plus bonus of {$9300.00}, or {$89000.00}. Based on the documentation and the above analysis, this is a {$34000.00} overstatement of annual income. It should be noted, my modification request did indicate my base income at {$84000.00} due to an expected increase which is supported on my supplemental paystubs with base of {$83000.00}. Effectively this would reduce this overstatement to {$30000.00}. 
For my spouse 's income, she is a XXXX and her salary is listed on the paystub. The base salary was not considered and Nationstar used the gross income which included a {$170.00} one-time income earnings adjustment to take advantage of a paid pre-planning event. Since this is not a stable income source it should not be considered as part of stable qualifying income. Again, stability of income was disregarded by Nationstar and they determined her income to be {$43000.00} rather than her actual income of {$41000.00} as indicated on her paystub. 
Ultimately, I appealed their income determination and this was rejected. Their rejection is on the basis that the supplemental documentation provided is considered new information. None of the supplement documentation was new information. The original income documentation provided did not support the income Nationstar used to qualify and the continuance of all income sources was not addressed by Nationstar. Based upon the response by Nationstar, this appears to be a systemically negligent policy and has likely negatively impacted many people requesting modification.",Mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",1

Shortly thereafter, I arrived at the bank when I made contact with a bank employee whose name I can not recall assisted me in cancelling my old checking and savings accounts for new ones. Prior this incident a fraudulent check was deposited into my account on XX/XX/22 for the amount of {$930.00} with my forged signature. The check was from a company called XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX. Upon making that discovery I responded to my branch when I made contact with an employee name XXXX who assisted me with cancelling my accounts for new ones. I stated to XXXX that only two agencies deposit checks into my account and they are my employer XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and the Internal Revenue Service and no one is authorized to withdraw. In exercising due diligence a security pin was set up to deter future fraud attempts going forward. After the second incident I asked the bank employee how could {$950.00} be withdrawn from my account if a security pin was set up and I was advise that the security pin was removed but no one can give an answer as to why. It should be known that the security pin was removed without my knowledge or consent. 
I was told by the bank employee an investigation would be conducted and my {$950.00} will be credited after 90 days. On XX/XX/22 I made contact with CHASE Fraud Dept via the aforementioned number when I was told my funds shouldve been credited to my account a long time ago and if in 5 business days my funds were not credited to call back. On XX/XX/22 I made the call but on this occasion I was communicating with CHASE Fraud Dept Located overseas. The Overseas Fraud Dept Personnel stated that Based on their investigation my ID was used together with my signature and I did not report my ID was stolen and the case was closed. I told the investigator I never lossed my ID so there was no report to be made in addition which bank location the Fraudulent Check was cashed he refused to give me that information. In conclusion CHASE does not have any Clear and Convincing Evidence that Im responsible for this fraud but theyve made that decision anyway. Im hoping that your agency can look into this matter to hold CHASE responsible for their error in protecting my accounts. Thanking you for your attention in this matter.

14091279,"To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally request reconsideration of the denial of my fraud claim regarding {$5000.00} that was coerced from me on XX/XX/year> under severe duress through a sophisticated phone scam. 

I received a call from a number that appeared on my caller ID as the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The men on the line identified themselves as law enforcement officers and claimed that I was under investigation and would be arrested immediately unless I complied with their instructions. They had highly detailed personal information about me and my children, which made their threats even more credible and terrifying. 

Despite my initial doubts, the level of detail they knew about my life, combined with the call appearing to come from a legitimate law enforcement agency, caused me significant distress. I am also a past victim of armed robbery, and this call triggered intense emotional fear and panic. These feelings were exacerbated by the fact that I am pregnant and that the callers had detailed information about my children. I feared for my safety and the safety of my children. Under this emotional duress, I followed their instructions and went to XXXX to send multiple transactions totaling {$5000.00} using my Capital One card. 

After the panic subsided and I was able to safely process what had happened, I contacted the actual sheriffs office and confirmed this was a scam. I also immediately contacted Capital One to report the incident. Unfortunately, my initial fraud claim was denied. 

I respectfully ask that you reconsider my claim based on the following : This was not a voluntary transaction. It was made under extreme emotional duress caused by a credible and targeted impersonation scam, which exploited personal trauma and used sophisticated spoofing techniques to impersonate law enforcement. 

The perpetrators used caller ID spoofing to make it appear that the call was coming from a legitimate government agency, which is a known tactic used by scammers and has been acknowledged by the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) as increasingly common and dangerous. 

I am a trauma survivor of a prior armed robbery. This event triggered a heightened state of fear, panic, and compliance that led to my coerced actions. I would not have sent this money had I not truly believed that I or my family was in immediate danger. 

This was reported as a scam immediately after I was safe and able to fully understand what had happened. I have since submitted a report to [ insert police department or relevant agency if applicable ], and I am willing to provide any necessary documentation to support this claim.

I understand that chargebacks typically cover unauthorized or fraudulent transactions, and I respectfully assert that this situation qualifies. The transactions may have been entered physically, but they were not made of my own free willthey were the result of a criminal threat and psychological coercion.

The scam I experienced is consistent with a type of fraud identified by the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) as an imposter scam, specifically involving law enforcement impersonation and caller ID spoofing.

Key characteristics of this fraud included : Spoofed caller ID : The incoming call falsely displayed as the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, increasing the perceived credibility. 

Use of threats and fear : I was told I would be arrested immediately if I did not comply. They referred to specific personal details about my family, heightening the urgency and emotional distress. 

Coercion to make payments : I was instructed to physically go to XXXX and make transactions under surveillance, mimicking cooperating with authorities.

Exploitation of past trauma : As a past victim of violent crime, I was especially vulnerable to this type of psychological manipulation.

According to the FTC, these scams are sophisticated, highly manipulative, and leave victims feeling overwhelmed and confusedoften only realizing what has happened after the immediate fear subsides.

I would be grateful if Capital One could further investigate this matter with a lens of compassion and understanding for victims of targeted fraud and trauma. I have been a responsible customer and am asking only for protection under circumstances no person should be subjected to. 

I have also attached a letter from my therapist, XXXX XXXX XXXX. Please let me know if additional documentation is needed to support this request. I appreciate your time and attention to this matter and hope for a fair resolution.

Here are the details of my case : I submitted a lease application for a unit at XXXX XXXX XXXX but never signed a lease, moved in, or occupied the property. This was because the leasing agent at XXXX XXXX XXXX later informed me that the unit was made unavailable after I had begun the lease application. I then communicated with the leasing agent that I would like to terminate the application as the unit was not available anymore. This prompted me to ask for a refund for the {$40.00} application fee. 
The property management at XXXX XXXX XXXX proceeded to charge me {$320.00} for an undisclosed reason for which I communicated to the leasing agent that I would like those charges to be disqualified because the unit I wanted was no longer available. 
The leasing agent neither issued a refund for the {$40.00} application fee after I provided the necessary information to issue a refund nor communicated with the property management that the outstanding charge should be waived. 
Two years later, I received notice from Qualia Collection Services claiming I owed {$320.00}. I was never told what this debt was for prior to collection efforts. 
Under fear of credit reporting and to protect my credit score, I paid the full amount on XX/XX/year>. 
After paying, I requested documentation for the debt, and I received a statement from XXXX XXXX XXXX labeling the charge as a Move-Out Charge even though I never moved in or had a lease agreement. 
Tracking the paper trail, I never lived in XXXX XXXX XXXX and as such should never have been charged for a so called move out fee.

Things didn't turn out exactly the way they were suppose to so on XX/XX/24 I opened up a dispute with Chime Bank about the charges. They then opened their investigation into the matter on XX/XX/24. I inquired about a provisional credit to make up for the money that I was out of. They told me that since the matter was a credit card, not my debit card that it fell under different rules so there would be no credit given on the account until after 10 days, 20 days at the latest. During this time I read on the laws and what happens under Regulation Z about a credit being applied after 10 days etc etc. I have no contacted the bank on 3 different occasions the latest left me on the phone with them for 2 hours 29 minutes, transferred 6 times. Some of the representatives were rude and almost hostile towards me for questioning the lack of funds being given for the credit. They kept trying to shift the blame to the merchant which I told them is not the problem, the problem is the credit given to the customer while the investigation is ongoing. Again they cited Regulation Z and that because it was a credit card, not a debit card different rules apply. My understanding is that I do not have to pay for the charge on my credit card until after the investigation has concluded. I explained this to several representatives that I have indeed already paid for this charge because when I made the purchase, I had transferred money from my checking account to my credit card account and then made the transaction. You can not make a purchase on the credit builder account unless you have the funds available and you move them to that account and you no longer have access to them. In my statements from Chime, they show the transfer from the checking to the credit builder account on the XXXX. They then show that the money was paid to XXXX on the XXXX. I then opened my complaint on the XXXX XXXX  XXXX and then Chime shows to have paid the bill to the Credit Builder Account on XX/XX/XXXX. The bill has been paid and they say they are giving me a credit on the next billing cycle. That is all fine and dandy except for the fact that they have already taken that money out of my checking account. If I was writing a check to them for the amount, they would not be able to charge me for that amount and it would therefore remain in my checking account and I would have access to those funds. I have asked them to credit my account back for that amount until the investigation is done which is scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. They have a repeated history of holding on to any and all funds possible whenever there is any kind of hold or whatever put on the accounts especially holds from hotels for incidentals. This isn't the first time they have done something like this. A previous time I transferred the money from the checking account to the credit builder account and then made my reservation. The money some how disappeared between the two accounts but the hotel saw the hold put on the account. They refused to pay for the bill even though they had the funds because they were not showing up in my account. Several days later they blamed everything on the hotel and said it was their fault which at that point didn't matter anyway because I had been forced to sleep in my vehicle that night. I stay at that particular hotel every month and have never had a problem with them only when I use the Chime Credit Builder Card. Just like now, I am in a different city and need to get a hotel room but I can't because I am short on the amount needed which would easily be taken care of if they would provide the credit to my account. At the bottom of every Credit Builder Account Statement it says regarding any disputes : We will investigate your complaint and will correct any error promptly, if we take more than 10 business days to do this, we will credit your account for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.

The Notice claims that I owe {$21.00} for an alleged debt regarding tolls incurred by some automobile, however, it is impossible to read the license plate number from the photo that the debt collector has included on the XXXX XXXX Notice. 

The Collection Notice fails to provide the following required information : A debt collector must provide the consumer with certain basic information. If that information was not in the initial communication and if the consumer has not paid the debt five days after the initial communication, all of the following information must be sent to the consumer in written form : The amount of the debt The name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed Notice that the consumer has thirty days to dispute the debt before it is assumed to be valid Notice that upon such written dispute, the debt collector will send the consumer a verification of the debt or a copy of any judgment If the original creditor is different from the current creditor, notice that if the consumer makes a written request for the name and address of the original creditor within the thirty-day period, the debt collector will provide that information. If, within the thirty-day period, the consumer disputes in writing any portion of the debt or requests the name and address of the original creditor, the collector must stop all collection efforts until he or she mails the consumer a copy of a judgment or verification of the debt, or the name and address of the original creditor, as applicable. 

False or Misleading Representations A debt collector, in collecting a debt, may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading representation. Specifically, a debt collector may not Falsely represent or imply that the consumer committed a crime or other conduct to disgrace the consumer.

1745642,"I am writing to you because I feel that I have been severely wronged by Wells Fargo. I had lost my job and was 2 months behind on my mortgage and doing my best not to miss another payment for fear of falling into foreclosure. I had also had to file bankruptcy due to my financial situation. One month I could not pay the mortgage until the XXXX of the month and the lender sent me a notice of pre-foreclosure and said they could not accept my payment because my file had fallen into pre-foreclosure. I tried for over a year to get the hardship assistance from Wells Fargo and they played constant games with me. They told me I had to be at least 3 months behind before they would review me for any assistance. They also kept switching customer relationship managers every month. I could never get the same person on the phone. Even though I sent paperwork multiple times they claimed they never received it. When I did get them to acknowledge that they received it, the next time I called in, the next rep would tell me they lost my paperwork. They also would tell me that certain documents were not received on time and made me apply and re-apply over and over again. Wells Fargo made this process very frustrating for me. I am a good person and believe in paying my debts, but the way Wells Fargo has treated me, I do n't think they want me to keep my home. I have a legitimate reason for hardship and my mortgage is 55 % of my gross monthly income. If Well Fargo would just do the right thing and lower my interest rate and payment from the 5.25 % adjustable loan I am in, then I would be able to afford my bills and the mortgage with money to spare. I think the real reason Wells Fargo is denying me is that they see that I have some equity in the home. From what I understand, this is not a valid reason to deny my hardship. I know that I meet all of the federal criteria. I just want to keep my home. Please help me get this resolved with Wells Fargo. I know they were fined a lot of money by the government last year specifically for playing the types of games they are playing with me, but I guess that fine was n't enough because they are still violating the agreement with the government.

However, I for got to make that slight increase to my online banking queue, so the XX/XX/year> payment went out for the old amount. Honest mistake, because I am dealing with grave family health issues and work. 

Turns out that Mr. Cooper placed me into default status - despite receiving a timely mortgage payment of {$3200.00} ( pre-adjusted amount ) - because it was short the {$510.00}. Instead of applying what I sent they opted to place the slightly short payment in a holding account for some reason which caused the default. I do not understand how one can be placed in default for less than {$200.00} in XXXX month. That seems predatory. Also, they opted to place my ( slightly short ) payment in a holding account.

They were able to see on my account that I contacted them through chat agents to try to dispute, and they said that calling is the only way, and I am currently in a tough position to be able to make any calls at the moment. They have ignored emails I have sent them, and appear to once again not want to issue the full refund for XXXXive items totaling {$65.00}. If Wisely was able to get into my account and see my chat history with their agents, then it would seem they should be able to also see my transactions from XXXX.

2223960,"XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX Below is my complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and is an example of why the American people are angry with the government and its agencies for not holding the Big Banks accountable ( one of the biggest is Wells Fargo ) in helping the American Homeowners get affordable mortgage modifications and stay in their homes. 
I am a XXXX, single, XXXX woman who works XXXX jobs and have been trying to get an affordable Mortgage modification from Wells Fargo while in Bankruptcy. 
I am a victim of Predatory lending. I was given a pick-a-payment loan in XXXX by XXXX XXXX who is now Wells Fargo. Before Wells Fargo took over from Wachovia who had my mortgage at that time, they told me that in order to qualify for the Help for Homeowners mortgage modification program I had to be in default of my loan. They advised me to stop making my payments and then I would qualify. So, I stopped making my payments to qualify. They also said because of my age and the fact that I was an unmarried single woman that women are considered a high risk. 
I filed for Bankruptcy in XXXX of XXXX. I filed a modification and had XXXX meditations with my attorney, Wells Fargo 's Attorney and an attorney who was a mediator for both parties. 
In the first mediation, for a new modification for a fixed mortgage of {$320.00} at 2 % and they said the new payment would be {$1000.00}. My attorney said I was paying that to the trustee and there would be no problem. My attorney questioned their Good Faith estimate which they used to try to show how I did not qualify. He asked what the {$7000.00} fee for forced place home owner 's insurance and also the incorrect amount of my salary by not including my bonuses from both companies I work for. Their attorney agreed that if this was reduced and the bonuses where included this would help in me being approved. 
The mediator said that she would waive her fee for the next meeting to get this resolved for all parties. Wells Fargo attorney told everyone that once I submitted proof of new Home owner 's insurance and a Letter of Explanation of my bonuses, that my figures were good and I would have no problems qualifying and getting approved for the modification. We all agreed to meet again after they received the paperwork. 
That same day, I sent my attorney a new Homeowners policy for XXXX and more pay-stubs the next day along with a Letter of Explanation regarding the bonuses I receive from both companies I work for. My attorney submitted the paperwork to Wells Fargo the next day. 
Wells Fargo refused to meet with us again to review everything, and instead sent a denial letter for the modification. 
So, I filed all over again several times and finally got approved ; I spoke with XXXX XXXX my Wells Fargo loan specialist who told me I was approved for {$290000.00} modification at 2 % fixed mortgage with a payment of {$1500.00}. I made my XXXX Trail payments I was required to make and after the third payment they sent the new modification paperwork. 
However, the new mortgage modification I received the note went from {$290000.00} to {$640000.00}. The house only appraised at XXXX. 
How was I denied a {$320000.00} mortgage and now am approved for a {$640000.00} note? This is nothing more than predatory lending again! How can a XXXX, single, XXXX woman in bankruptcy, sign a Mortgage Note for more that the house is appraised for? What I want as an outcome is an affordable fixed mortgage based on what I was denied in the first mediation and even now at 2 % at the appraised value of the house which is {$290000.00}.

I rejected their policy as was my right in favor of my own less expensive policy with he same coverage. 
I believe the policy US bank issued is with their affiliate and US Bank benefited from the transaction financially without disclosing the affiliated relationship to me. 
Despite my securing my own flood insurance US bank refuses to remove the forced placed escrow despite the fact i obtained and maintain a fully paid annual flood policy. 
US bank has permanently raised my monthly mortgage payment by hundreds of dollars per month against the terms of the note I signed. 
US Bank alleges I am in default and have threatened foreclosure, and have instituted aggressive collection action against me. 
I have paid my payments timely every month since inception of this loan based on the amount of the note and mortgage. 
US Bank has not used best practices in dealing with me as their customer and has set up a self serving "" suspense '' account to hold my timely mortgage payments and deem them late each month due to what they call a "" shortage ''. 
US bank is charging me late payment penalties and penalty interest on the fictional payment that they contrived that I refuse to pay. 
US bank is reporting to credit agencies that I am in default of my mortgage adversely affecting my credit rating despite my timely payments.

1742204,"From conference calls XX/XX/XXXX,XX/XX/XXXX,XX/XX/XXXX, it became clear - because Wells mentioned it -- Wells ran a 3rd appraisal they never told us about, once again drive-by though I requested many times an on-site appraisal. I need to see this appraisal and I have 30 days to examine and/or dispute it - not only under Dodd-Frank, but the FCRA Fair Credit Reporting Act { 15 U.S.C. 1681 } as outlined by the Comptroller of the Currency, Administrator of National Banks holds that if adverse action was taken against the consumer, the consumer has 60 days from discovery of this information to "" obtain and examine the details of the negative information so that if erroneous, the consumer can correct it. '' Adverse action is defined as "" an action in connection with an account that is adverse to the consumer 's interests. '' Furthermore, Section 615 ( b ) ( 1 ) states that if the adverse action taken was based on information obtained from a third party ( such as a third party appraiser ) then this information must be provided to the consumer within a reasonable period of time. That being said, please send me this third appraisal you mentioned on our phone call as required by law. 
( 3 ) But perhaps the most surprising and unfortunate revelation from our last phone call was Wells mention of the possibility of a "" partial reinstatement '' for an amount less than our full arrears - proving that, all along, going back to my XXXX offers to bring the loan current in XXXX payments before we even entered the mod process - Wells can and does accept payment arrangements - as mentioned in their Notice of Default - they just do n't offer these arrangements in a timely manner because it is their preference ( more profitable ) for Wells to foreclose. 
Further problems with Wells servicing include asking me to enumerate my concerns with their modification, then leaving me a subsequent phone message - about a whole new raft of items ( pay stubs, etc ) they would like to see from me, "" moving forward. '' The problem with this is they are picking and choosing which banking laws they 're going to comply with and which not as they go along, what the deadlines are and even if there are any, asking me to jump through hoops they are arbitrarily creating, when in fact there is much federal and state law that defines how you should have handled my modification already and should be handling it now. 
Under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ) as administered by the Department of Housing & Urban Development, Wells has established a "" pattern of non-compliance, '' for which there are civil penalties. This is Title 12 Chapter 27 US Code 2605 section F "" pattern of non-compliance. '' By pattern of non-compliance I mean every step of the way, Wells has not abided by how Dodd-Frank demands a modification must be run -- the consumer 's right to see and dispute my NPV data inputs, my right to dispute your shoddy drive-by appraisals, and so forth. As recently as XX/XX/XXXX, the Wells servicing associate XXXX XXXX said in a recorded phone conversation : "" Why do we need to re-run your NPV with the corrected inputs - it 's not going to make a difference so long as there 's equity in your home you 'll never get modified anyway. '' This is like saying "" we 're not going to read this guy his XXXX XXXX because we 've already decided the verdict. '' But Dodd-Frank is the law, I have numerous times requested my NPV be re-run with my thorough appraisal, and Wells has yet to comply. However they have established a very thorough pattern of non-compliance. Last thing : Wells put an underwriter on the phone with me who said, "" We DID our job, got you your keys and got you in your house.

When they told me that it was in XXXX and my Boss traveled to another country already ( shes a owner of resturant chain so she travels alot. ) so she can't show up in person, then the branch workers and people in the call center said that since she was not in XXXX she can let her priviate banker contact my boss by phone or email and get this check verified.

''??? I'm sorry? because of Chase 's workers misconduct that leads me to use more than a month to trying to deposit my own money into my own account, it's not my fault at all. So they told me an alternative solution, my boss ( sender of this check ) can call Chase and she have the rights to revoke this check and take back the money, then the owner can issue me a new check. So I have to contact my Boss again and let her call using international line and cancel this check and take back the money.

My mortgage payment has always been {$970.00} In XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo notified me by mail that my account had a negative escrow amount due to increased property taxes. They decided to raise my payment to {$1300.00} per month. This is an increase of {$410.00} per month. I am on a fixed income and live a simple life. I called them and explained to them there was no way I could afford this increase. They said to try to make the payment. 

I started looking at refinance options with other lenders. The month of XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX., XX/XX/XXXX. and XX/XX/XXXX.  I continued to make my regular mortgage payment of {$970.00}. In XX/XX/XXXX. I paid a little more as I had a bit extra. My payment for that month was {$1000.00}. I was able to obtain a refinance approval with a Lender. We were ready to draw loan documents. The Lender pulled a back up credit for the Wells Fargo mortgage. They informed me that Wells Fargo was reporting me being 30 days late on my mortgage. I showed the bank all my receipts. I went to the XXXX branch today and stated my case. I spoke to a supervisor in the Loan Servicing Department. 

They informed me that they did receive my payments, ( which were made in the branch ). However, they did not apply them to the principal and interest They were placed in "" unapplied funds '' account. This allows them to take my payment and apply it to the negative escrow. I informed them that was not disclosed to me at the time I made my payment nor did I agree to this. The Supervisor, said to fax a letter and they would investigate. 

In the mean time, I am unable to proceed with my new approved loan as Wells Fargo is showing me 30 days late in XXXX. I am enclosing all the documentation I have. All I ask is that Wells Fargo apply my payments to the my loan balance and not report me late. 

I became aware that the property taxes went up due to a HERO loan I took out for Solar Panels. This loan is tied to the property taxes. They file an addendum to my tax bill. This cause my property taxes to go up. This new refinance will pay off the HERO loan and save me over {$500.00} a month. I am XXXX years old. Have a humble life with a small house in XXXX County. Wells Fargo is not acting out on the customers best interest. They will be paid off including the negative escrow balance.

There 's never been a hearing per Maryland required Statue Rule 2-311 ( f ),  MD Rule 14-204, and Rule 20535,. I challenge the fraudulent foreclosure and sale of my home that I 've been in for 11 years 2. I have previous letter and documents where Ocwen did this same fraudulent act back in XXXX, where I had an attorney where they took my house out foreclosure and I had Senator XXXX XXXX office involved and have documentation to support. They 've admitted to the same crime and was never held accountable for it, but retaliated against me with another fraudulent act. However, per Government records it shows Ocwen & XXXX XXXX have been fined 60 billion for their continuous mortgages fraudulent activities, but victims are continuously suffering from what 's continuing to be allowed. 

3. I also have a letter stating that my house was taken out of foreclosure and received a very small settlement per that fraudulent foreclosure back in XXXX. 

4. I had a private investigator to investigate the entire fraudulent sale of my home XXXX, with recorded XXXX report and other documentations to show this was the same approach taken back in XXXX per OcwenXXXX XXXX. Due MD statue any fraudulent sale of someone 's property and this not being the first time, the sale is 100 % invalid and my certified private investigator is willing to go public and testify in court! 

5. The fraudulent foreclosure was in conflict with MD Rule 14-404. Based on legal doctrine the foreclosure was "" not actionable as a matter of law, '' and the court lacked the jurisdictional power to ratify the sale 6. The Circuit Court 's denial of the motion to vacate the fraudulent foreclosure sale and dismiss action, without holding a hearing, when the ruling was dispositive of the case was a mistake within the confines of Rule 2-311 ( f ) and Rule 2-535 ( b ). Which creates "" manifest injustice! '' 7. My private investigator have backed up recorded videos & documentation of the entire illegal eviction that took place, that 's continuing to be allowed across this country to thousands of homeowners.

I hate to believe our Government is involved with illegal activities and on standby to continue to allow this type of activities to happen!

6328811,"I wrote Firstmark Services to request the removal of a negative credit remark on my co-signers credit file, due to a late-payment made on my Firstmark via XXXX student loan. 

In XXXX, I reached out to Firstmark asking for consideration due to a XXXX refinance pay-out not covering my loans in full, resulting in my owing to 3 different Firstmark accounts XXXX All of this happened at a time in which XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, my spouse losing her job and my cosigner being out of the country on business ( all of which I reported to Firstmark and was assured was being taken into account ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I wrote to Firstmark again to ask for consideration due to owing so much for those first few months but was told there was nothing that could be done, in fact an agent mistook me asking for "" full loan forgiveness '' due to my XXXX, which I never requested. Firstmark company policy outlines that a negative remark will not be filed on any late payment made less than 30 days past due. I had confirmed this with a customer service representative on the phone in early XXXX, who told me that I had until the end of XXXX to make a payment before a credit report would be filed. I was assured that a payment made before XX/XX/XXXX, for a XX/XX/XXXX payment, would keep me from being reported as delinquent. I therefore made a one-time payment on XX/XX/XXXX, in order to avoid being reported on the XXXX payment. 

On Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, while recovering from XXXX, I received a panicked call from my co-signer that her credit had tanked due to a late payment re : this account. I immediately made the payment, in full, and brought the account date so it would not hit another late period. I then touched base by phone with Firstmark to ensure receipt of the payment and to ask for grace regarding the negative mark on my co-signers credit. The Firstmark agent told me that the negative remark was irreversible. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX, my account was completely up to date and I also made the XXXX payment early, as a sign of goodwill. In guidance with company policy, my XXXX payment was made weeks before the 30 day late remark period, which would be XX/XX/XXXX according to the above referenced conversation with a customer service rep in early XXXX, and should not have been reported as past-due On XX/XX/XXXX, Firstmark emailed me that they were glad they were able to fully resolve your issue. This email was in response to a formal letter requesting the deletion of a negative remark Firstmark made on both my own and my co-signers credit report. Earlier on XX/XX/XXXX I had a very unpleasant conversation with a customer service representative who yelled at me. Considering this, I was confused by the email in question sought clarification on the issue. 

The goodwill letter that I sent was sincere Firstmark, in its request, but I felt the email received on XX/XX/XXXX, in reply was confusing, as it does not actually take my query into account specifically as my issue has not been at all resolved. I am also mailing a letter to the CEO of Firstmark to discuss the treatment I received from the various customer service agents.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,1

4663187,"On Monday, XX/XX/2021 I initiated a bank transfer from my checking account at XXXX XXXX  to my account with Paypal. While the Paypal website indicates it takes XXXX to XXXX business days to complete a transfer, I find this unacceptable. 

All banks today are capable of completing a wire transfer within a few minutes and an ACH payment in XXXX hours. After initiating the transfer at approximately XXXX AM on XX/XX/2021, I was alerted at XXXX AM on Tuesday, XX/XX/2021 that the funds had been withdrawn from my XXXX  checking account. 

Later on XX/XX/2021 I contacted Paypal to find out when the funds would be available in my Paypal account. They only stated XXXX - 5 days. The Paypal website indicated funds would be available by XXXX PM on XX/XX/2021. 

On XX/XX/2021 I contacted Paypal again. I explained that I was concerned that the funds had left my XXXX XXXX  checking account at XXXX AM on Tuesday, XX/XX/2021 and that the funds are not available or pending in my Paypal account. I asked if they could tell me where my funds were and they were not able to do so. I then inquired if it was possible to have the transaction reversed, and again they told me I was not able to do that. 

I contacted XXXX XXXX  and asked if they would be able to cancel the transfer. Since the funds had already been withdrawn from my account, they could not cancel the transfer from XXXX XXXX. 

I am concerned that Paypal is holding funds unnecessarily and for prolonged amounts of time in order to profit from these funds being held on the inrta-day money market or by other means using my funds to their benefit and to my detriment. Further, because Paypal is unable or unwilling to offer a reasonable explanation as to why it takes so much longer for them to comlete a transaction compared with other banks and online financial services companies, I feel they should be held liable to show proof as to why the transfer process takes the amount of time they state it does.

6591130,"I purchased my home with Freedom mortgage in XXXX of XXXX and as a 100 % XXXX XXXX  living in Virginia I do NOT have to pay taxes on my house. 

When XXXX, which is the escrow/tax recovery company Freedom mortgage uses XXXX pulled my tax statements from XXXX XXXX they would NOT except my tax statement of XXXX $ which I am granted. 

So XXXX illegally pulled the prior years records that were of the former owner and used those against me. 

This is identity theft of the former owner. 
And federal fraud against me as I am NOT the former owner and have different taxes, tax rates and discounts. 

These are not blanket statements, but fact, as legal statutes are in place to prohibit companies from doing this. 

I informed Freedom mortgage of the error in XXXX of XXXX and by XXXX had both Freedom mortgage and XXXX  on the phone understanding what they did and promising to fix it. 

I requested an audit of the account and was told it would take place. I have never received the results of any audit. 

I was told to contact my county and pull the tax statements to help. 
I reminded them of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as I am 100 % XXXX and would need help doing this, they didn't care and would not help. 
My county are the ones who informed me of how XXXX broke the law and pulled the former owners tax statements. 

Then to make matters worse Freedom mortgage didn't actually pay part of my taxes and blamed the county, just as the county was informing me of the non payment. 
This may be confusing but by law as a 100 % XXXX XXXX  with a XXXX  loan it is Freedom mortgage 's responsibility to handle my taxes, not the XXXX  's responsibility. 

Not only did they NOT fix it but inflated my escrow to accommodate the new tax information that was fraudulent and only months later paying the late tax bill. 

This added {$300.00} a month and for the next 18 months continued to bill me and hurt me no matter what I told them. 

In XXXX of XXXX I finally got someone on the phone that seemed to understand the situation and received again promises of fixing and refunds before XXXX XXXX. 

This again was a lie and nothing was done. 

Then a check for the last 6 months refund came in, however nothing for the prior year. 

When contacted Freedom mortgage stated they couldn't send me a check for the remaining tax refund and could only refund into the escrow. This is a blatant lie as we had received the prior refund check AND it is against federal law to hold more than {$500.00} dollars in overages in escrow and those overages must be refunded to home owner. 

Freedom mortgage then blamed the county treasurer for not sending them back the overages. Another lie as the county did but to an address XXXX gave them that they now "" claimed was no longer in use ''. 

The county treasurer when asked at ANY time during the 18 months for the refund said it was illegal for them to give it to me that Freedom mortgage had to. 

Freedom mortgage agreed with this fact but said they were always waiting on the monies from the county to be given back to them after they over paid the taxes from the escrow. 

Another lie as the county had proof of checks sent, not once but twice. 
Freedom mortgage refused to address the situation at the start of XXXX and refused to work with the buyer in sorting this out even though the buyer is who had the documentation, tax papers, and all other proof of incident. 

On XXXX XXXX XXXX the checks were refunded by the county treasurer under instruction of Freedom mortgage against federal law. 
As I can only access this was so Freedom mortgage didn't have to contact me or deal with me. 

No formal apology for 18 months of XXXX, no apology for the fact that the XXXX dollars per month stolen from the veteran was their food money for the month. 


Freedom mortgage customer service refused to help, the tax department refused to help, XXXX refused to help. 

When they finally agreed to help after threats of publishing what they had done and proving what they had done they said to always ask for a supervisor when calling in BUT XXXX  me be lower customer service never allowing me to talk to the supervisor. 

Now I have new bill for UNPAID taxes received this first week of XX/XX/XXXX which Freedom mortgage refuses to address.

4803467,"On XXXX, I sent in, via fax, a credit withdrawal request form to get {$10000.00} from my line of credit, to Champion Mortgage. My loan number is XXXX. The next day, XXXX, I called to verify receipt and processing of my request and they said they had no receipt of it. I told them that it had been faxed and the fax transmission sent report showed it went thru to the fax line successfully. In the past I have had trouble getting funds every time as they always seem to have some hoop I have to jump thru to get my funds. 
Sometimes they say the fax didn't come thru properly or it was not readable. But my end showed it was sent successfully. 
In the past they have told me when I call in to verify receipt of my request, they say it only takes a few hours for them to be able to verify receipt of the request for funds. 

Then, other times they say it takes up to 2 to 3 days for them to be able to verify that they received my request for funds. Just today, when I called to see if they had my request for funds, and they said that they had no receipt of my fund request, they said that now they require I have to be subject to a call from them sometime after they receive my request, for them to verify if I did indeed sent in the request for funds. So, it now seems that someone with a reverse mortgage serviced by them, has to have a phone in order to receive funds. A supervisor told me this morning that if I am no't home or didn't answer the phone, and after they leave a message asking for a call back, then they would deny the credit draw request. 

I don't recall seeing any such requirement in my HUD reverse mortgage loan. 

Last time I made a request on XX/XX/XXXX of this year, they were giving all of this same kind of run around and hassle, saying that my fax was not readable ( in spite of it showing successfully ) and I'd have to send in another one. I asked why can't I sent it in via an email, as in the past, and they said they discontinued that practice. But, after some complaining and speaking to a supervisor, they got approval for me to send to a higher level supervisor via email and he approved it and started the process for it to be sent to my bank account, as has been way I get my funds. 

So, you can see, that it is always some form of added measures or steps, that I have to comply with to get funds from my HECM loan. They state they are a debt collector and it shows in that they love to harass and make things difficult, on purpose. They seem to always want to stall the process of receiving funds via a reverse mortgage loan.",Mortgage,Trouble during payment process,1

This complaint is in reference to misappropriation of HOA payments I have made and payments made on my behalf by the Federal Bankruptcy Trustee XXXX XXXX XXXX. The HOA is threatening to foreclosure on my home for alleged outstanding balance of {$26000.00} they claim are outstanding assessments but are, in fact, entirely attorney collection fees for a debt that was paid in full! 
The JUDGMENT AND ORDER, AND THE TRIAL COURTS RULING, was conducted without my knowledge of the law suit, court session. The summary judgement that was granted to the HOA In XXXX of XXXX because I was not notified and therefore not in attendance. It was not until years later that I because aware of this judgement when the law firm made attempts to garnish my wages and bank accounts. When I attempted communication with Lueder, Larkin & Hunter they refuse to acknowledge all the errors and mistakes in account along with dirty service that resulted in they ability to obtain a summary judgement. I reached out to them to in provide proof the debt was paid in full over a five year period because I volunteered to add the HOA in my bankruptcy case. 

I attempted on several occasions and thought the court system to no avail. Their excuse is they have a summary judgement and it does not matter that it was the result of errors or mistakes. Instead of them providing requested ledgers and proof of the alleged debt, they added more attorney fees. I have attempted to fight this judgement because it was based on errors, mistakes as well as I was not serviced, informed or allowed my day in court. I have appealed to Superior Court as well as filed both a discretionary appeal and direct appeal to the Georgia Court of Appeals. The filings appear to have been reviewed by attorneys in the judges office and or clerks, stamped with the judges signature. In the Court of Appeals filing was Not reviewed by three judges but reviewed and signed by a clerk. The appeals were accepted, however the response was the Appellant Court does not have jurisdiction. Every attempt to expose the truth of the matter that the summary judgement was obtained in a allegedly deceptive manner and the alleged motive seems to be the firms manner of collecting legal fees not money for the HOA because their is no money to to the HOA!

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX from the HOA & their attorneys threatening to file a judicial foreclosure on my residents if I do not pay the full amount of {$26000.00} within 30 days from the date on the letter.

This is a blatant misuse of the legal system to collect a debt that was paid in full. Furthermore, I have continued to pay the HOA and have hand delivered this years assessment, in full through XXXX first of XXXX. The Current management company for the HOA signed for the payments but since I have not received an updated statement and was ordered by the attorneys in the aforementioned letter dated XXXX first that I can not communicate with them I have no idea what they are doing with my payments.

This meant that I needed to wait until XX/XX/XXXX ( the 10 days ) for the payment to post or be deemed missing.

I did NOT express the amount of the payment in that chat. There has been ZERO other communication other than that chat. So .... The only way that they could say that the {$7200.00} payment is missing, is because they have received the payment and saw the amount. 

Also, they sent the email on XX/XX/XXXX, saying that the payment is missing which is only 7 days after it was dropped in the mail. Per their policy, they estimate 7-10 days from the mailing date before payment would be posted. Why would they email us 7 days from the mailing date saying that the payment is missing when they allow up to 10 days of processing time? Not to mention the ONLY way they could know the payment amount is by receiving it and seeing it themselves. 

I spoke with them on the phone today, XX/XX/XXXX in the afternoon EST, and when I asked them how they knew that we sent a {$7200.00} payment, they could not tell me. And I know that I have still not told them the amount that I sent. 

I also asked why they sent me an email stating that the payment is missing after 7 days and they allow up to 10 days before it is deemed missing, and they also could not give me an answer. 

I was told that they need to forward my questions to "" somebody on the payments team '', but that I could not speak to them myself. They said I would hear back from somebody with answers to my questions regarding how they found out that the payment I sent was for {$7200.00} and also why they deemed my payment missing after 7 days when their policy is to allow up to 10 days. They said it would take 7-10 days before I would get a response to these questions and that it would come either through email or a mailed letter, they do not know which. When I asked if I could speak to somebody or get the contact info to contact them, they said I can not. They also said that even tho I will get a response to my questions in 7-10 days, they said it may take 30 or more days to complete the payment process. I did not understand why this is and I feel this is completely unsatisfactory.

4770816,"SUMMARY : There have been multiple unauthorized changes to my account that occurred internally to the PNC system. PNC has not been transparent in the handling of this security breach on my account. 

FULL DETAILS : XXXX XXXX : I reviewed my account statement and noticed the address on the document was a completely different address based in Colorado. I nor the authorized user on the account have or had any association with this address whatsoever ( which is on the other side of the country ) Upon review of old account statements, it appears the address was changed in XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX. In statements prior to the XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX statement, the address was correct. 

I never authorized this change and I was never notified of this change in address. 

I raised the issue with Online Support immediately and changed my password as a precaution ( even though the password is not shared with other accounts ). The specialist indicated there was no record of the address being changed in their internal system. She did the following : ( 1 ) corrected the account address and ( 2 ) escalated the issue to the PNC security team for review. She also said I should be receiving a letter in the mail confirming the change in address. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I received a call from Retail Support, I described my issue and they then sent to the security team for review. 

Week of XX/XX/XXXX : Security team called me and told me the security issue has been resolved and no further details can be provided. 
I asked how the change happened and what else has been compromised ( account information, identity, etc ). The specialist said no further details can be given. 

This raises my concerns further as to why PNC is not being transparent in the nature of the breach and they are not providing any guidance whatsoever on what corrective action needs to be taken ( no suggestion to change password, freeze credit, etc. ) XX/XX/XXXX : I go to my local branch and remove the additional authorized user from the account. 

XXXX XXXX, XXXX : Through online chat, I request closure of the savings accounts in my Virtual Wallet account ( Reserve and Growth ). Checking account ( Spend ) remains open. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I access my account online to review my debit card settings. I am unable to find my settings so I use online chat for assistance. After some discussion, the support specialist says my debit card was closed on XX/XX/XXXX. She is unable to provide any detail on why it was closed. 

Same as before, I never authorized closing the debit card and I was never notified of the closure. 

I am still in possession of the debit card which was good through XX/XX/XXXX so it wasnt expired nor lost. It was also not inactive as I was using it frequently during that time and even used it that same day on XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX : After much confusion and frustration regarding the administration of my account, I visit my local branch to review this whole issue in person. The branch banker confirms the debit card was reported lost/stolen on XX/XX/XXXX. He was not able to confirm who reported it lost. He also could not find any record of the address change in XX/XX/XXXX. 

This raises the question was a security review even performed in early XXXX XXXX if they did not even find the debit card closure during the period in question? I am discovering issues on my own, why isnt PNC sharing the extent of the breach? 

If my debit card was reported stolen, why didnt PNC notify and re-issue a new card?

PLEASE HELP ME GET THIS GO VIRAL! PLEASE SHARE!!! This happened to me and I dont want it to happen to anybody else! 

I have been trying to reach out to # BankofAmerica to help me resolve this problem but nobody cares! On XX/XX/XXXX, 2017 I went to deposit {$3300.00} cash in an atm right outside the bank in XXXX XXXX, Texas. ( All {$100.00} bills so I was following all of their rules of how to use ATM right ). The machine took my money counted it, spit back out {$300.00} bills one of which was stuck so I was only able to take {$200.00} out and then its sucked the other bill in and the machine went back to the home screen. It never deposited the money on my account so I went inside the bank I told them about what happened, however they didnt even shut down the machine! they just said that they cant help me and gave me a phone number to call and told me to make a claim. 

I did as I was told and both times I called about my claim it was denied and all I was told was that there was no extra money found in the ATM machine. {$3100.00} was never deposited into my account. I spoke to managers of the claims department who refused to give me his full name ( I just know its XXXX ) or contact information of anyone higher than him in the corporate office. I tried to get a hold of someone through social media, her name was XXXX and she told me that nothing could be done and they wont give me contact information of anyone higher. 

I went to police who in the end said that they wont be reviewing the footage because its too long and they just believed the bank investigators who are saying there is no video footage that proves that ATM machine messed up and that I put that money in at all! On video its hard to see what exactly happened when I was there. And the footage was too long for them to watch to double check if the ATM spit that money out at some point later. Apparently their cameras are not there for customer protection, they are just props that are not functioning. Manager said if anything went wrong on the machine it would have shut down on its own, but it didnt!! It malfunctioned and no one would admit it. Certain steps should have been taken right away and other people shouldnt have been let use the ATM until it was checked. 

Someone stole my money and I dont know what else I can do and who else I can reach out to since even police refused to dig deeper. This money didnt just disappear in thin air. It could have been people behind me or ATM workers or the Bank itself that has my money. 

I am warning all # BankofAmerica customers!! Your bank does not care about you and will not help you XXXX forbid something like this happens to you! Machines break and I understand that but # BankofAmerica said they didnt even send anyone out to look at it when it happened they only looked at the transactions form the malfunctioned machine from their office which obviously didnt show any malfunction on their end.

3545429,"Dear Sir or Madam : I am writing with great concern about inaccurate information about my credit history being used to determine my FICO Credit Score. My FICO credit score used to be in the 800s, now recently it has fallen to XXXX without any changes to any of my credit reports. I have contacted both TransUnion and, most recently, XXXX  to try to correct this matter to no avail. 

I have always taken my financial credit history very seriously and have been very diligent in paying all of my debts off in a timely manner throughout my entire life. I have never even had a late payment and certainly not a delinquent account, contrary to the information XXXX  and TransUnion are using to create my credit scores. Somewhere along the line, data about me has been entered incorrectly or files have been merged with someone elses information. 

I called XXXX  about this problem on XX/XX/XXXX of this year and they were unable resolve anything for me. They asked what account information on my credit report with them was incorrect, but that is the issuemy entire credit report is clean without any negative marks against me, which is not reflected on the FICO credit score they are giving me!

They were not able to find any negative marks against me on my credit report, but acted like these scores are carved in stone tablets and only the hand of God could change them. They gave me some convoluted maze of logic about the FICO Score Model they use, ignori
ng the lack of negative information about my history.

One of the Customer Service reps at XXXX  told me to get help from a Financial Credit Advisor, insinuating that it is my lack of financial responsibility, when in reality, it is their lack of accuracy and responsibility in safeguarding US citizens financial welfare. An everyday citizens ability to buy a home, vehicle, insurance or get a loan depends on these companies being accurate with these FICO scores. It is the fault of management of these Credit Bureaus for their employees carelessness in handling peoples precious financial information and lack of training in correcting their mistakes. They are great at trying to upsell you on monthly credit report services or somehow boosting your score by paying for it. Try just adding the correct information into peoples files in the first place. 

We are all well aware of XXXX carelessness and lack of security that exposed millions of taxpayers financial information to identity theft. I guess this carelessness is systemic to that industry. Eventually, I hope the US Congress steps in and restructures the way these companies operate. 

I had no other alternative than to pursue this issue through an official government complaint. I have attached my credit reports and screen shots of my credit scores as evidence to support my claims.

They said that someone had called in the automated system, increased my atm withdrawal, moved my savings to checkings, and withdrew from a post office atm several times. I asked the atm withdrawal limit to be reduced. I then moved the remainder of my savings back to savings. They put back the fraudulent charges as well but said that I needed to go to a branch in person since more fraudulent charges seemed to be occurring that day. The representative gave me a confirmation number for the claim and said they put a note to not accept automated phone call changes until I was in the branch in person to confirm identity. 

I called the automated WF system on XXXX XXXX home to make sure the pin change was effective, but it was not. It would still only accept the original pin and my account did not seem to be frozen.

I explained my situation and eventually was recommended to just remove all my money from my accounts so I did. {$10000.00} was removed from my savings and checking accounts. Finally a banker was able to see me and she called to make another claim when we realized there were even more charges to my account.

10579242,"XX/XX/year> Subject : Complaint Regarding Inaccurate Late Payment Entry on Credit Report. 

Dear CFPB, I am submitting this formal dispute regarding inaccurate information on late payments reported on my credit file maintained by Experian for the account XXXX with XXXX XXXX  XXXX. Despite sending previous requests for correction ( letters dated XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year> ), no action has been taken, which violates both the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). 
FCRA Non-Compliance Under 15 U.S. Code 1666b, creditors are obligated to provide periodic statements at least 21 days before a payment 's due date. The erroneous reporting of late payments on this account indicates a failure to adhere to this requirement. Furthermore, 15 U.S. Code 1681i compels credit reporting agencies to ensure the accuracy of information in consumer records, which has not been upheld in this case. 
TILA Non-Compliance The Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) stresses the importance of providing accurate and timely disclosures to consumers. The incorrect late payment reporting has unfairly damaged my credit score, thereby breaching this obligation. 
Protection Against Non-Payment of Obligations Act ( PAANL ) This act also mandates that creditors issue timely statements to avoid unjust penalties to consumers. The late payment reporting discrepancies on my account suggest a failure to meet this responsibility, resulting in unfair damage to my credit. 
Discrepancies in Payment Reporting For the account with XXXX XXXX  XXXX, the following discrepancies have been observed across the credit bureaus : Experian : The account shows an erroneous 30-day late payment in XX/XX/year>, a 60-day late payment in XX/XX/year>, and a 90-day late payment in XX/XX/year>, despite all payments being timely and consistent. 
Recurring Errors The persistent incorrect reporting of late payments across XXXX, Experian, and XXXX reflects a pattern of inaccuracies. These late payments have been wrongly reported even though my payments were made on time and the account was on autopay. 
Request for Immediate Resolution I request that these inaccuracies be promptly corrected and that the incorrect late payment notations be removed from my credit report. The information should be updated to reflect my actual payment history, which is 100 % on-time. If this issue is not addressed within 30 days, I will pursue further action, including legal steps and filing additional complaints with regulatory agencies to safeguard my rights as a consumer.

2399093,"I applied for a loan modification with Specialized Loan Servicing LLC. 
To date, the documentation and information SLS has sent me and the conversations I have had with their service representatives has been unproductive and do not address my questions and concerns. I have applied for assistance under Making Home Affordable but have never been offered a workout option, loan modification, or solution to my foreclosure situation, as required under the California Homeowner 's Bill of Rights. They received my complete application package on or before XX/XX/XXXX but instead of reviewing my application for acceptance for a modification, they refused to review my application, and subsequently never submitted for decision my HAMP modification without notification and scheduled a foreclosure action. It was n't until I called in and spoke to their representative that I found out my application was not being considered for modification. 

With all the recent news regarding stories of predatory lending practices and illegal foreclosure processes, I have become increasingly concerned that I am a victim as well. Their representatives have caused me to feel like you are trying to hide something. I am worried that potential fraudulent and deceptive practices by unscrupulous mortgage brokers ; sales and transfers of their mortgage servicing rights ; deceptive and fraudulent servicing practices to enhance balance sheets ; and deceptive abuse or fraudulent accounting tricks and practices may have negatively affected my credit rating, mortgage account, and/or the debt I am legally obligated to satisfy. 

There are several details and discrepancies about my loan that have come to my attention and which have me deeply concerned. Of primary concern is the fact that the purported trustee, Specialized Loan Servicing LLC, was never legally substituted as trustee as required under CA law. 

Apparently, my loan was also pooled and securitized and converted into an investment stock and held under a trust unbeknownst to me and it is unknown who is the securitized trust. To my knowledge, an Assignment of Deed of Trust was never created and recorded by XXXX naming XXXX as beneficiary, as also stated in the Notice of Default. I 'm unsure exactly how my loan would be assignable to a new beneficiary as successor when it had already been securitized. This has resulted in me having grave concerns and questions as to who actually owns my loan as beneficiary. 

I have demanded that they produce evidence of the original or certificated security regarding loan number XXXX with a QWR, including all endorsements and/or allonges. In the event they are unable to supply me with said security, I will view that as confirmation that they never created nor own beneficial interest in such security. 

The Original Deed of Trust, recorded XX/XX/XXXX, indicated XXXX as the trustee under the original signed deed of trust, yet the Notice of Default indicates XXXX as the "" Duly Appointed Successor Trustee, '' and the Notice of Trustee 's Sale purports that SPECIALIZED LOAN SERVICING LLC is the Trustee of Record. 

I assert that there was never a Substitute of Trustee document issued by SPECIALIZED LOAN SERVICING LLC, XXXX, XXXX, or other beneficiary, and recorded in XXXX XXXX XXXX granting SPECIALIZED LOAN SERVICING LLC authority designated as a trustee for the purpose of this foreclosure action. Therefore the Notice of Default and Notice of Trustee 's Sale are void and of no effect. Conducting a Trustee 's sale without being legally appointed as trustee is is a violation of California Civil Code 2924 ( a ) ( 1 ), and gives me grave concerns about what other violations they are committing. 

Please help me resolve this issue.

I paid off the legal fees and missed payments and got out of foreclosure, and since them I've been making my payments on time yet I've accrued many months of missed payments and associated late fees. It seems to me that there is a processing error on Shellpoint 's part of which I have never been notified, and I am finding it impossible to pay them the amount that I owe. 

Last month I twice tried to pay off the outstanding payments. The first time ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I assumed I had cleared up the problem by paying {$5300.00}. I noticed, however, that my "" regular monthly payment '' had increased to reflect the amount that I owed in late fees, as opposed to my agreed upon monthly payment of {$1700.00}. Ten days later I noticed the balance hadn't changed. I once again ( XX/XX/XXXX ) attempted to pay off the balance and once again I assumed that I had settled the problem. 

Today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I received a notification that {$6900.00} was going to post to my account and logged in to see that my payment history indicated immediate refunds of the amounts I had paid when they originally posted and did NOT deduct them from the supposed balance I had accrued despite my having been up to date on my monthly payments. 

I am now trying to pay and receive an error message and they won't accept any amount in payment. I can not figure out why they won't post my payments to my account and it feels as if there is a predatory ignorance that will result in the foreclosure of my home.

When it came time to adjust my payment went up almost {$400.00} a month but somehow I was able to hang on.

I reached out to DiTech to make a payment and to see what could be done to get everything sorted out. I was shocked when they refused to accept my mortgage payment. I was even more shocked when they told me that they would not be able to offer or even consider any type of modification or repayment plan or anything because I already had a "" good rate ''. They stated the only way I could fix this was to reinstate the entire delinquent amount, which was not possible at that time.

They also could have put the late payments back into the balance of the loan and just increased the term or something.

13709159,"The purpose of this letter is to file a complaint about deceptive practices and discrimination initiated by Lakeview by XXXX. Specifically, Lakeview by XXXX has made an error which increased my monthly payment by XXXX dollars and has offered no resolution or taken accountability for the financial situation that they have put me. 
The error was made on my escrowed taxes for the year of XXXX which has negatively impacted me both financially and emotionally. The total error which impacted my escrow negatively was {$7400.00}. 
I was recently notified through mail on or around the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX that my escrow was short by {$7400.00}. The shortage was to increase my monthly payment by nearly a XXXX dollars a month with an effective date of XX/XX/XXXX. 
Since receiving this letter I have called numerous times to Lakeview by XXXX and have been told the following with no follow up communications from Lakeview by XXXX. 
XXXX. During my first call to Lakeview by XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, I was told that the XXXX XXXX XXXX notified XXXXLakeview that XXXX was 1XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX verification form. I never received notification from Lakeview by XXXX or the appraisal district of this change. During the same phone call, I was transferred to a member of an escalation team who then said there was no form or documentation in my file. If this response was true, I would have received a letter from the appraisal district regarding the changes to my tax exemption status. During that same call, I requested a copy of the XXXX party verification document and for it to be noted that I am requesting it sent to my residence by mail. Even though I was just told that the document did not exist, I made the request for it to be mailed to me because if the call is recorded, then the call will reveal that the prior representative was providing false information. I never received a copy of the document requested. At the end of that call, I was told that this was going to be sent to an escalation team who would then get back to me by Friday, XX/XX/XXXX. No one did. 
XXXX. On or around the XXXX of XXXX, I took time off from work and went to the XXXX XXXX XXXX and to the office in XXXX TX XXXX While at the XXXX XXXX XXXX they stated that the only documents they have is my initial request for my homestead exemption application. Nothing else was in my file. I was then told to go to the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX for any other questions. I then asked for an extension of my time off due to having to go to another office. At that office they provided me with tax bills that were issued to XXXX/Lakeview and were paid by Lakeview by XXXX XXXX. Neither office has any letter that was to go to me or my mortgage company stating that I was tax exempt or reversing their decision for me to be tax exempt, which is what Lakeview by XXXX has responded to me as their position in this matter. 
XXXX. About a week went by when I called Lakeview by XXXX to let them know of my visit to the appraisal district and that the document your representative was in my file was not in my file with the tax office. Your representative lacked candor in this matter and misrepresented the company with unsubstantiated rhetoric. 
XXXX. These transpired days after I needed to pay an additional {$1000.00} a month for my mortgage payment and the thought of the increased payment caused me XXXX  and stress. When I called again, I was transferred to someone on the escalation team who said that they can try to help me get the shortage of the escrow spread out over the next XXXX years. I said that the increase was unaffordable on my single monthly salary. I communicated to the companys representative this was an administrative error made by YOUR company and I wanted a plan I could afford to request it be spread over 3 years. 
XXXX. Shortly after my call, I received a letter stating my mortgage was increasing close to {$510.00} a month instead of {$1000.00} because the escrow shortage was spread over XXXX years. My request for a three-year spread was denied with no explanation. I strongly believe that if the escrow shortage was able to be spread over XXXX years that my payments would be more affordable for me. 
XXXX. I called again to let them know that the XXXX year spread for my escrow shortage was not what I requested as a remedy to resolve this situation. It is my position on this matter I need to be accommodated as a customer. This has caused me financial hardship due to the administrative error made by Lakeview by XXXX. I was told again my concern would be sent to an escalation team and that someone would be contacting me. 
XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX spoke with someone after not receiving a response from Lakeview by XXXX after XXXX weeks lapsed and was told that my request was denied. I asked to speak to someone regarding the same matter. I explained my situation and how it was never resolved with any answers or call back from anyone. During this call I was told that once again the issue was going to be escalated. They told me that the outstanding escrow which was an administrative error can be placed at the end of my note through the process of a mortgage counseling review and that it would be escalated. I was also told that because this was an administrative error made on the part of Lakeview by XXXX that I would not need to apply for this request as usual as I was put in this financial hardship because of Lakeview by XXXX error. 
XXXX. I then received XXXX letters in the mail dated XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX stating that they received my application for a Loss Mitigation review. The second letter stated that my application for the review was missing all necessary documents to proceed with which I was told I wouldnt need this because it was an administrative error on Lakeview by XXXX part. The letters I received contradicted the conversation I had with the person on the phone. 
XXXX. On or about XX/XX/XXXX after receiving this information and getting responses from your representatives with verbal promises that never came to fruition I called and asked to speak to a supervisor and to record the call. When the first representative came on the line, I was told that the call was being recorded. I mentioned that I too was recording the call. Immediately I was told that I could not record the call on my end. I requested to please be transferred to a supervisor. Over an hour later I spoke to a gentleman named XXXX who said he was a supervisor. Discussing my issue once again he mentioned that my case had been closed. I said XXXX calling regarding the same matter that has always been the same matter since XXXX. Theres been no resolution made to close the case. XXXX changed focus only on finding out why my status was changed to XXXX XXXX XXXXx exempt. During this conversation he says, I see here looking at the notes that we spoke with XXXX at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who said I was XXXX XXXX XXXX. I said that is weird, so we have gone from a missing XXXX party verification form now to a call saying to change my homestead exemption tXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX, Lakeview by XXXX XXXX  representative on this matter, provided no last name and said he had no call back number or extension. He stated he would call me back once he received a response from a department that holds correspondence letters to see if they can provide him with a copy of this XXXX XXXX verification form previously mentioned. XXXX called back at XXXX XXXX that evening to let me know that someone had responded to his request for the information and once he receives it, he will call me back. It is now Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX and I have not received any notification via phone call, email, or mail.",Mortgage,Trouble during payment process,1

16985712,"I am submitting this complaint regarding Wells Fargos inaccurate calculation of my mortgage loan balance, principal, principal and interest ( P & I ), escrow shortage, and monthly payment, as well as the mishandling of my case by their executive office representative, XXXX XXXX ( Wels Fargo Executive Office Representative ) assigned to my initial complaint ) My concern is the principal listed as XXXX as of XX/XX/XXXX, I made an extra payment of XXXX for 6 months ( total XXXX ), my principal should have decreased, instead it went up XXXX Loan Type : XX/XX/XXXX Adjustable-Rate Mortgage Interest Rate : 7.12 % as of XX/XX/XXXX Term Remaining : XXXX years XXXX. Incorrect Principal, Interest, escrow shortage and Loan Balance On XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo sent me a payment change notice effective XX/XX/XXXX, showing : Principal : {$260.00}, Interest : {$610.00}?? ( Wells Fargo online listed as XXXX ) Escrow : {$270.00} XXXX : {$1100.00} However, Wells Fargos online system showed interest as {$580.00}, which matches my actual loan amortization schedule. The incorrect use of {$610.00} instead of {$580.00} led to an overstated monthly payment. 


Between XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I made extra payments of {$300.00} each month toward principal ( total of XXXX ), yet my principal balance increased instead of decreasing. This indicates Wells Fargo misapplied my payments or used incorrect balances and interest accruals in their calculations. 
Despite this, the servicer calculated my principal as {$280.00} for monthly payments and escrow, and my loan balance decreased from {$100000.00} ( XX/XX/XXXX ) to {$99000.00} ( XX/XX/XXXX ). After my regular payments in XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ( {$1200.00} each ), my balance only decreased to {$98000.00}. As of XX/XX/XXXX, my XXXX is 6.5 %, principal portion {$290.00}, interest {$530.00}, escrow {$380.00}. 



XXXX. Escrow Shortage Miscalculation On XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo reported an escrow shortage of {$1400.00}. 

After I switched homeowners insurance on XX/XX/XXXX, lowering the premium from {$1300.00} to {$880.00}, and deposited escrow refund of {$290.00} toward escrow on XX/XX/XXXX, the shortage should have been calculated as {$730.00} ( XXXX ) XXXX the difference between the previous and new home owners insurance Wells Fargo, however, continued to XXXX {$980.00} as the shortage in their system and subsequent recalculations. 

XXXX. Incorrect Monthly Payment Recalculation On XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo issued a new payment notice showing a total monthly payment of {$1200.00}, which was based on : Principal of XXXX instead of XXXX Interest of {$610.00} ( incorrect ; should be {$580.00} ) Escrow shortage of {$980.00} ( incorrect ; should have been {$730.00} ) Because these figures were wrong, the total payment of {$1200.00} was miscalculated. 



On XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo issued another payment change notice with a new interest rate of 6.5 %, showing : Principal : {$290.00}??? Why principal went up with the lower APR rate of XXXX from 7.12 %?? 
Interest : {$530.00} Escrow : {$380.00} calculated with inaccurate escrow shortage of XXXX instead of escrow shortage of XXXX XXXX : {$1200.00}??? 

This new payment was also based on the incorrect escrow shortage of {$980.00}, so it remains inaccurate. 


XXXX. Mishandling by Wells Fargo Executive Office Representative XXXX XXXX from the Wells Fargo Executive Office was assigned to my case. He : Insisted that {$610.00} was the correct interest amount, despite internal records showing {$580.00}. 
Asked me to send a screenshot from my online account to prove it. 
Claimed the {$290.00} payment was applied to the escrow shortage, but used the incorrect {$980.00} shortage in the recalculation. 
Sent multiple irrelevant documents, including XXXX calculations, even though I requested a recalculation only for XXXX, the year my insurance changed. 
Was unprofessional and unhelpful, refusing to accommodate reasonable scheduling for calls.

Hodosh and Lyon 's demand letter references the same debt ( account ending in # XXXX or # XXXX ), however, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX, has called me twice and admitted XXXX had NO records for the XXXX  statement and account ending in # XXXX ( and later changed to # XXXX by XXXX ). No credit application with my signature, no proof of charges I made. 

While the alleged originator of debt, XXXX, has admitted they have no proof, Hodosh and Lyon falsely claim this office, in consultation with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, have thoroughly reviewed your account and have concluded that all charges were properly assessed to your account. 

Hodosh and Lyon did not stop there. They made additional and intentionally false claims against me by attaching two unrelated statements from XXXX cards in years XXXX and XXXX, ending in # XXXX and # XXXX. They also falsely point to airline travel at that time and charge-offs in XXXX. What was charged off was fraudulent activity!! Nothing I personally charged. 

I am a well-documented victim of identity theft, see police reports attached. Hodosh and Lyon are fraudulent debt collectors who bought an alleged debt that even the originator ( XXXX  ) can not prove. They continue to pursue an innocent person by MANUFACTURING alleged proof. Their letter ( attached ) is false as NO proof exists that I ever signed up for the subject XXXX XXXX  card ending in # XXXX, which account was allegedly changed to XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX.

14778727,"I, submit this formal complaint against Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian for their continued and willful violations of federal consumer protection laws under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). These violations include the unlawful reinsertion of previously deleted accounts without proper notification, failure to ensure maximum possible accuracy, failure to investigate disputes within the mandated time frame, failure to provide verification details upon request, and failure to validate debt prior to reporting. 

Background & Violations My credit reports contain fraudulent accounts and unauthorized inquiries that the Bureaus have failed to properly investigate and address despite multiple disputes and supporting documentation. Additionally, these Bureaus have removed fraudulent accounts and unauthorized inquiries only to reinsert them without proper validation, constituting an egregious violation of 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( a ) and ( b ).

Furthermore, I sent a certified dispute letter to all three credit bureaus requesting verification details, including contracts, signatures, and all relevant documentation for these accounts. Despite more than 15 days passing, I have not received any response or documentation from any of the bureaus, which constitutes an additional violation of federal consumer protection laws, specifically : 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) : Failure to investigate disputes within the required 30-day period.

15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) : Failure to provide notice and certification before reinserting previously deleted information.

15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) : Failure to ensure maximum possible accuracy.

15 U.S.C. 1692g ( a ) ( 4 ) : Failure to provide verification of debt, including original contracts and signatures, upon request.

15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ) ( B ) ( iii ) : Failure to provide specific details on dispute findings. 

Related Lawsuits & CFPB Actions The CFPB has actively taken enforcement actions against the credit bureaus for similar violations, further demonstrating a pattern of noncompliance. These legal precedents reinforce the validity of my complaint : Experian Lawsuit ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : The CFPB filed a lawsuit against Experian for failing to properly investigate consumer disputes regarding credit report inaccuracies. The lawsuit alleged that Experian allowed erroneous information to reappear on reports, impacting consumers ' credit, employment, and housing access. The CFPB seeks to halt Experian 's misconduct, provide redress, and impose penalties. 
TransUnion Settlement ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : The CFPB, alongside the FTC, reached a {$15.00} XXXX settlement with TransUnion and its subsidiary, TransUnion Rental Screening Solutions , Inc., for failing to ensure the accuracy of tenant screening reports. The agency charged that TransUnions inaccuracy potentially hindered consumers ' ability to secure housing. TransUnion agreed to pay {$11.00} XXXX in restitution and a {$4.00} XXXX civil penalty and implement enhanced accuracy measures. 
Equifax Lawsuit ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : The CFPB filed a major lawsuit against Equifax for repeated violations of the FCRA and deceptive practices that misled consumers regarding credit report accuracy. The lawsuit highlighted that Equifax knowingly reported incorrect information, failed to correct disputes in a timely manner, and continued to allow erroneous reinsertion of previously deleted data without proper consumer notification. The CFPB is seeking financial penalties, injunctive relief, and systemic reforms to prevent future violations. 
These actions underscore the CFPBs commitment to enforcing the FCRA and ensuring that consumer reporting agencies uphold their obligations. My case mirrors these past violations, and I urge the CFPB to take similar action against Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian.

Ensure that these accounts and inquiries are not reinserted without proper validation as required under 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ).

Written Confirmation : Provide written confirmation of the removal of these accounts and inquiries along with updated copies of my credit reports.

Thorough Investigation : Conduct a full investigation into how these fraudulent accounts and inquiries were recorded without my consent. 
Provide findings in writing, including all requested verification details, such as contracts and signatures. 
Compliance with Identity Theft Protections : Implement fraud alerts and provide me with identity theft resources as mandated under 15 U.S.C. 1681g ( e ).

The continued noncompliance by Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian has caused significant financial harm and distress. The reinsertion of fraudulent accounts and inquiries without proper validation exacerbates these violations. Given the CFPBs history of legal action against these credit bureaus for similar misconduct, I urge immediate enforcement action to ensure compliance with federal law and provide appropriate remedies under 15 U.S.C. 1681n and 1681o for willful and negligent violations.

8520865,"XX/XX/2024 I did attempt to close only my primary account at BECU XXXX branch and remove my name from a non-equal joint account associated with my daughter. At approximately XXXX to XXXXXXXX XXXX I worked with an XXXX lady who helped me accomplish closing my primary savings and checking account. I was issued a cashiers check and she assured me that I had nothing more to do with BECU twice because I asked if I was on my daughters account still and the rep said "" no. '' However, while attempting to cash my check at the teller counter, I was asked for my accounts code word. Which I replied, "" I don't have an account anymore I just closed it. '' The teller went and got her manager and found out I was still tied to my daughter 's separate and primary account. I was then led to XXXX XXXX who removed me from her account, he did not close her account so I was told. Over the years I have had no access to her account but only to transfer funds into it and that is all. I have never had a debit card to her account, nor access to her debit card. She is the primary owner of her account. 

On XX/XX/2024 my daughter contacted me asking me, "" why '' I closed her account? That is not what I did, nor what I understood as having had happened. I called BECU and was connected to a rep that was seemingly reading from a script a narrative that was fraudulently false about our accounts and what type of accounts they were. The BECU rep on the phone said ourjoint account was me as anequal owner with my daughter. That is a lie. Then he said that he could see that I was refused a withdrawal of the fund 's moments later by the bank teller at the counter. Another lie that did not happen. I began to get irate over the phone, because for years this kind of misuse of my account and the details of it changing and even being used by other people has gone on for quite some time. I stopped online banking all together with BECU because of someone who is not me, accessing my online passwords locking me out of my accounts, denying bills to paid automatically, and even my secret code words were being changed. The rep on the phone brought into question the nature of the joint account being equal, which it was not. I could only transfer funds into not take away and that is it. My daughter and I both understand this to be the case. Angry at the discrepancy the phone rep alerted me to, I left work to go to the bank. When I arrived at BECU of course the account reverted back to a not equal ownership joint account and everything appeared as it should have. The XXXX XXXX XXXX bank manager had assured me that I needed to have my daughter come in to fix the problem with her debit card that was cancelled. Something I did not initiate or do, nor understand was being done. 

So what script was the phone rep working from and who was supplying disinformation about the nature of my account and its status with my daughter being of equal ownership? What is the purpose of this narrative? This representative of BECU fictionalized the description of the business that I initiated, and even the services I was provided. Why is it a necessity to change what actually took place and replace it with a false narrative about a sequence of events that never took place, seemingly for some nefarious secret reason. And this has been going on for years with my account and the abuse I have endured is from the abusers working inside BECU 's discriminatory practices they have used to sincerely hate and discriminate against me. 

I have been denied any recourse to have my online and technological complaints investigated at all. On top of being a victim of robbery by their ATM 'S, do they have to victimized me even more, stealing my money, changing my account information at will, allow criminals to enjoy using my account to make charges to my account that I did not receive goods or services for, despite me not being an online shopper and asking them to help me get to the bottom of it. The only way this information of mine could be escaping is from untrustworthy bankers employed with BECU themselves. It was THEIR atm 's that stole XXXX 's from my cash deposits XXXX dollars, at three different locations. I can prove how much money I received and deposited but BECU never even asked during their so called "" investigation ''. This indicates to me complicity with the pirates enjoying their free reign of thievery. Like the discriminatory institution they are, they lied straight to me and said what happened to me never happened to me as they STOLE {$300.00} dollars with their crooked Atm 's and never reimbursed me. BECU seemingly enjoys gaslighting me on top of their other technological abuses and robberies that they ALLOWED to continue to happen to me.

OnXX/XX/2020 I experienced a water line leak in my home and completed the documentation required to get my homeowners insurance to cover the losses related to the damage. These damages necessitated the removal of the back wall to the studs, removal of all flooring all the way to the concrete slab, removal of base cabinets, removal of dishwasher, removal of counter top, removal of sink and dishwasher, removal of drywall between kitchen utility room, removal of all flooring in utility room, removal or window framing, and removal of interior door and door frame. From XX/XX/20 to now the entire back wall, false dividing wall, flooring, cabinets, countertops, dishwasher, sink, garbage disposal, door and window frames, and insulation have been removed ( as shown in pictures below ). I have had a demolition and drying service come in and remove all water damaged materials and set up dryers for four days. The damage from the leak resulted in complete loss in my kitchen and have left myself and my daughter without a functioning kitchen for nearly 4 months as we have no other source of running water we have had to do dishes in the bath tub and utilize the sink in our only bathroom of all cooking and cleaning, as well as having no cabinets or countertops surface for storing dishes and food and no way to adequately prepare food items. 
Their incompetence and mis information has resulted in significant delays in my ability to repair my kitchen and make my home functioning for me and my daughter. I was given misinformation regarding the insurance check from one of your representatives, who stated I just needed to mail the check and an overnight return mailer to get it endorsed. I spent over {$50.00} in shipping costs following his instructions. The misinformation also resulted in a two-week delay in getting accurate information on how to get funds released. I spent hours on the phone with various representatives to try to get funds released and was moved from representative to representatives, this delay resulted in over a month delay from when my insurance company mailed me the claim check to me getting the money to make the significant purchase needed cabinets and installation. This delay then resulted in the cabinet order being placed at the end of XXXX and being impacted by the COVID 19 closures. I am now in the process of again being moved from  representative to representative in the attempt to get the remaining funds released so that I can purchase and order the countertop so it can be installed with the cabinets and my kitchen plumbing can be restored. This misinformation, mishandling, and incompetent practice has resulted in untold harm to my family due to the compromised living situation, along with making implications that I am mishandling the insurance funds. I have presented receipts totaling {$5300.00} for repairs and materials up to this point, more then the funds released and I am still told to additional proof is needed to release funds my insurance company has provided for me to finish this repair. I am a single mother and have lived in my small home for over 12 years with my daughter. We only have one working sink in the bathroom and have been forced to do dishes in the bathtub and live amongst boxes on the ground and exposed pipes for nearly 4 months due to the mishandling of this case and the ignorance of the representatives at XXXX.

8442292,"CREDIT COLLECTION SERV XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX I checked my three credit reports and found an assumed collection account from CREDIT COLLECTION SERV with different opening dates, balances, first date of delinquency, balance due, and/or last date of activities for this same exact account number. I have never had an account with this company nor any record of any type of first notice of debt including rights to dispute from this company. And if I, by chance, even though I have no recollection nor tangible record, naively spoke with a representative of this company over the phone about this debt, I was not informed by that representative that I had a right to dispute this debt nor a specific timeframe to do so. 

15 USC 1692g 809. Validation of debts ( a ) Notice of debt ; contents states that within five days after the initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt, a debt collector shall, unless the following information is contained in the initial communication or the consumer has paid the debt, send the consumer a written notice containing ( 3 ) a statement that unless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice, disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector. XXXX XXXX XXXX definition of the word receipt is- a writing acknowledging the receiving of goods or money ; proof, evidence. I never signed nor received any type of acknowledgement receipt from a mailing service for any mail from this company. I am familiar with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). Had I signed a receipt of notice for the proper and legal documentation from this company, I wouldve immediately responded asking for lawful verification of debt or copy of court ordered judgement well within the lawful 30 days allotted. After receiving my response letter with receipt, this company would have to legally cease from collection attempts and remove the account from my credit reports until their proof of verification is sent back to me. This company has reported to my credit reports without observing the FDCPA laws. My credit has been impacted adversely because of this companys irresponsibility. 

My credit reports also show that CREDIT COLLECTION SERV has provided this alleged account with inaccurate information. The FCRA requires that all data reported from the credit reporting agencies, creditors, or furnishers on a consumer 's report be 100 % ACCURATE, 100 % VERIFIABLE, and 100 % TIMELY. This means no data can be reported that can't be legally PROVEN to be 100 % accurate. I also understand that XXXX XXXX under {$500.00}, a paid XXXX XXXX, a collection less than a year old, or having a past due balance found on a collection account should not be listed on consumer credit reports. My XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX credit reports all show different and inaccurate open dates, balances, first date of delinquency, balance due, and/or last date of activities for this same exact account. 

This is erroneous and flawed reporting that is listed on my credit reports. Not only did this company not follow lawful FDCPA communications protocol, but it has also broken FDCPA False or Misleading Representations protocol as well. A debt collector, in collecting a debt, may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading representation. Specifically, a debt collector may not falsely represent the character, amount, or legal status of the debt, or of any services rendered, or compensation he or she may receive for collecting the debt. A debt collector may not communicate, or threaten to communicate, false credit information or information that should be known to be false, including not identifying disputed debts as such. Each of my 3 credit reports show different information instead of them all showing the exact same information. This is considered a false and misleading representation that this company has submitted to the credit reporting agencies.

Please remove this account from my credit reports immediately. It is not my duty to provide evidence that this alleged debt is not mine. It is the obligation of the debt collector to provide evidence that they can lawfully collect on any alleged debt, accurately report to the credit agencies, and follow all FCRA and FDCPA laws. As of today, they have been unsuccessful.",Debt collection,Written notification about debt,1

I had opened a new business checking account with another online company. I linked my Wells Fargo savings account with this online business account at another bank. Test deposits were confirmed by Wells Fargo. When I tried to transfer money out of WF into the new online account, I kept getting an error message ( transfer was denied to "" protect '' my account ). I noticed the transfer limits were much lower than the amount allowed to another online bank account I had. So I tried the lower amount. I received a call from WF fraud protection. I confirmed all of my info with that person. She said I should now be clear to make the transfer up to my low limit. She said this was often done with new linked accounts, but that I should not have any future issues with ACH transfers to that account. She said it could take an hour. I tried XXXX hours later. Would not work. I tried the next day. Would not work. 

Over the course of the next XXXX weeks, I spoke with more than XXXX PEOPLE at Wells Fargo, from lower level reps to supervisors, to XXXX different people at the "" customer advocacy office '' for WF, who eventually recommended filing a complaint on my behalf to the "" LineofBusinessExecutiveOffice ''. I filed more complaints because no one got back to me. I spoke with supervisors who spoke with the "" technical '' department, and no one could figure out why I could not transfer any money to my business checking account. NO ONE at Wells Fargo, more than XXXX people including several higher ups could tell me why I could not transfer my own money to my own business checking account.

A week later, I called and had to speak with someone else to try and reach her. She finally replied after a week. She could not figure out the problem. She said she needed to look into it. So another week passed, and she left another voicemail. I called her back the same day and left her a voicemail saying to please call me back. I also replied to her email in the WF secure messaging saying I left her a voicemail and to please call me back. This was a week ago now. "" XXXX '' has refused to reach out to me again. Additionally, she was not professional and was a bit rude the time I did talk to her, often speaking over me. She was pretty dismissive of the whole issue.

Key Issues and Violations XXXX. Failure to Remove Cancelled Debt from Credit Reports : XXXX XXXX issued a Form XXXX for this account, indicating that {$3200.00} was cancelled as of XX/XX/year>. According to IRS regulations, a XXXX signifies the cancellation of a debt, which should also be reflected in credit reporting. However, the account is still being reported as charged off and outstanding on my credit report, which is inaccurate and misleading. 
XXXX. Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) : Credit reporting agencies are required to ensure maximum possible accuracy in their reports. Reporting a debt as both cancelled and charged off is inherently contradictory and fails to meet this standard.

15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ) : XXXX XXXX  has not taken reasonable steps to correct or update inaccurate information following my dispute. 
XXXX. Misrepresentation of XXXX XXXX : The issuance of a XXXX constitutes an identifiable event of cancellation, as outlined in IRS XXXX XXXX. Therefore, continued reporting of the debt as outstanding or charged off misrepresents its legal status, potentially violating the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. 1692e ). 
XXXX. Harm to XXXX : This inaccurate reporting is materially harmful to my creditworthiness and ability to secure credit, as the account continues to appear derogatory despite the cancellation. 

Requested XXXX I respectfully request that the CFPB : XXXX. Investigate JPMCB CARDs compliance with FCRA and FDCPA regulations. 
2. Require JPMCB CARD to instruct credit reporting agencies to remove or update the reporting of this account to reflect the debts cancellation.

3. Provide written confirmation that the inaccurate information has been corrected or removed from my credit report. 

Supporting Documentation To support this complaint, I have attached : A copy of my initial correspondence to JPMCB CARD requesting the XXXX form.

Further, in my original request, while we filled out the application at their insistence, my goal was for a forbearance for a few months while we tried to resolve our marital affairs. In parallel, I maintained keeping my mortgage current by liquidating every retirement account that I have and vigorously explained in every conversation with Chase that I could not allow my mortgage to be late. The nature of my work with the XXXX requires a clearance and financial distress indicators could impact my employability and the status of my firm to do business with the XXXX -- in essence ensuring my financial insolvency. The most important thing in this process was not so much the decision that Chase reached but that they reached a decision expeditiously. At this writing, I have been in the "" appeal '' process for XXXX weeks and the newly assigned rep has yet to review the basics of my file and he stated on XXXX XXXX conversation that I should have filed an app by myself with my wife having signed a quitclaim deed. WE ASKED THAT QUESTION NUMEROUS TIMES IN THE ORIGINAL APPLICATION and original rep refused to answer that question. But to add insult to injury, he tells me that if I want to be reviewed solo then I MUST REAPPLY. Chase 's lack of appropriate and timely processing of my family 's request is literally forcing us into foreclosure but I struggle to keep my mortgage current b/c of the adverse professional ramifications. In close, our house is at least $ XXXX upside down and our mortgage is a negative ARM -- XXXX other major drivers for seeking a modification. Again, it is not so much the decision that Chase makes it is the intransigence to recognize that forcing me to re-apply when we made our situation clear from the outset, is enormously unfair and a potential destructive hardship to our family. But after my last dealing with the Chase rep, it was clear that he, personally, refuses to even review my file in a timely fashion and despite his assurances that he will do so and despite my vehement request, even to escalate my case to a superior. He advised me that I can not expect escalation despite his not reviewing my case file since he 's been assigned it XXXX weeks ago and that I have "" no further recourse. '' I 've attached Chase 's "" decision '' & you will see that they used our combined income ignored all the conversations, data and facts related to my wife NOT paying any household expenses and her taking her salary to pay for her new home [ where mathematically she could n't pay for both homes ].",Mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",1

I contacted the insurance department on XX/XX/XXXX and learned that our Insurance renewal due date was showing as XX/XX/XXXX in the system so even though the renewal bill was received timely by Flagstar it was not paid. 

I investigated further as to why they would have an incorrect date for our insurance and examined my Flagstar transaction history. I noticed a payment made to XXXX in the amount of {$1400.00} on XX/XX/XXXX for a policy number that did not appear to be ours. I then went and reviewed my XXXX account transaction history and confirmed that my premium in the amount of {$1300.00} had been paid at closing on XX/XX/XXXX and credited to our XXXX policy as of XX/XX/XXXX. No other payments were credited to the account from Flagstar. I contacted Flagstar customer service who then transferred me to the Insurance Department. 

The representative I spoke with advised that the bill paid in XX/XX/XXXX was for the prior owner of our property. She stated that the renewal bill had our address listed but contained the account number for the prior owner and had the names of the prior owners. Because the address matched our property address the payment was issued from our escrow account.

We paid a {$3500.00} shortage on XX/XX/XXXX covering this payment made to XXXX that was not ours to pay. Our insurance premium was not timely renewed and caused an increase in our premium.

Pursuant to RESPA 1024.17 ( k ) ( 1 ), If  the terms of any federally related mortgage loan require the borrower to make payments to an escrow account, the servicer must pay the disbursements in a timely manner, that is, on or before the deadline to avoid a penalty, as long as the borrower 's payment is not more than 30 days overdue.

The second thing they are doing incorrectly is after I've been with the deceased department for over 10 years when I finally paid the principal balance off ... they are now switching my account to a new Department ( please see Exhibit D ) and this department is changing the whole rules of the game therefore what I was told and promised by the old apartment is void compared to the new Department. Just to elaborate the old apartment told me to fax them a letter stating that since I paid my principal balance off I could have these fees removed and I did and they remove the fees now the new Department put the fees right back on. When I'm trying to pay this off. Furthermore that new department has me waiting over 4 months for an answer and they also after the old Department said that my principal balance was XXXX the new Department is saying that I owe a XX/XX/XXXX payment. 

3. The third thing they're doing incorrectly it's sending me letters telling me that I'm going into foreclosure telling me that they're placing lender-placed Insurance again which I don't understand because my principal balance is paid!!! These letters make me lose sleep. And they placed it in XX/XX/XXXX after I paid off my principle and they plan on placing it again in XX/XX/XXXX. 

4. The fourth thing is I've totally lost trust in this bank because about five years ago they were purposely losing my payments I would walk into a Wells Fargo and make a payment and XXXX hope that I kept my receipt because if I didn't they would say I didn't make my payments. About 5 years ago I requested help from Congress and they assisted me and they audited them and they changed their tune real quickly and found all my payments. The fact that they lost by payments when I was so close to being paid off made me think that they were purposely trying to take my house and foreclose on me. 

5. The fifth thing that they're doing incorrectly is they have their representative XXXX XXXX whose phone number is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX extension XXXX XXXX XXXX this person has had me waiting for resolution for over 3 months. He called me yesterday only to say that they are continuing to place Lender placed insurance and he still has no resolution that the anticipated resolution date was XX/XX/XXXX. ( Mind you I put my formal complaint with him Since XX/XX/XXXX ) Since then, I've called him every other Monday and what he tells me is he'll give me an answer in 10 days that they're waiting to drop the paperwork. He has told me this over four times/ for 3 months ... I believe that's a bit much. He told me not to make any payments until they come up with a solution. But they have dragged it out 3 months. 

I can't even sleep at night thinking that these guys are going to pull some kind of scheme and try to foreclose on me for fees I don't understand why they continue to put lender-placed insurance I don't understand why they moved my account to another department after I've been with the deceased  department for 10 years now this new Department doesn't know that I dropped {$7000.00} at one time they don't know my payment history they're just trying to collect and these fees but their fees they're not principle. So as a company Wells Fargo I know they're huge but the deceased department has helped me and telling me one thing and then they the new Department is changing the rules as if it were a new ball game, when I'm clearly at the end. The deceased Department told me : that I could pay off my principle balance and any fees once I paid off my principal balance those fees I could pay off at my own terms ... once paid off I can receive the paperwork. Furthermore the deceased Department invited me to fax them over a request to take off these fees and I did, I dont have that paperwork but it was faxed in XX/XX/XXXX to the insurance department and they took off the fees! yet the new department put them back on. 

Yet this new Department put the fees right back on. They often send me letters that they're placing new lender-placed insurance. They just sent one on XX/XX/XXXX when in actuality they already placed lender-placed Insurance in XX/XX/XXXX but they can't because I paid off my principal in XX/XX/XXXX. I can't even sleep at night I stay up worrying about being so close to pay my house off and these people pulling a fast one on a normal citizen like me. To the old department I'm totally paid off on principal and they took off fees the new Department said that I still owe one more payment and they put on a whole new set of lender-placed insurance on me..My concern is that I was totally paid off in XX/XX/XXXX and I have the receipt that says XXXX balance ( attached to this email ) on the principle but they transferred my account to this new department they said I still owe one more payment in XX/XX/XXXX ( where that came from count be explained ) they're incorrect they keep making me wait ... I've been waiting for 4 months, for a resolution ... I've been waiting for an answer on this and every time I call which I call every other week on a Monday they tell me they don't have an answer, but they will in 10 days and it's been since XX/XX/XXXXthat I've been calling and now we're going into XX/XX/XXXX so what are they trying to do they said I only order payment for XX/XX/XXXX but I don't want to think that they're making me try to go to foreclosure for fees I don't trust this bank I need XXXX XXXX strength I need your help. I know that her influence will get their attention and get them to do what they should be doing. They've been having me hanging on for 4 months without an answer and it's not fair I need her to intervene but I need to fully explain to her while my case is relevant. 

Attached you will find. 

Exhibit A letter from Wells Fargo ... that proves my principle balance is paid off. As of XX/XX/XXXX and then it  also shows the small fees for about XXXX Exhibit B Attached you also find a letter where they are stating that they can help if I'm going into foreclosure ... that's the letter that makes me not get sleep. How can I go to forclosure when i was told by the deceased department that if I paid off the principal, I could pay off the fees on my own terms. 

Exhibit C in the last attachment you'll find a letter where they're telling me on XX/XX/XXXX that they're placing lender-placed insurance I don't understand how when I made my last payment in XX/XX/XXXXon principal and my bill / ( Exhibit A ) reflex that I was totally paid off on principal. 


Exhibit D And the final attachment is the letter that says they're changing my account from one Department to a new department they even change my account number they changed everything this far the ball game. 

I feel that Wells Fargo has totally mismanaged this account I feel that since they're so big they have different departments executed to try to get their money 's however if you're in the deceased department and they tell you one thing it's still Wells Fargo they can't just change the game on you when you've almost won the game they can't change the rules at the end I need your help because this is my family 's future this is my patrimony this is the home that I paid off that my mother when she passed away left to me and this will be my children 's home and my grandchildren please help me!!! Thank you. In advance!

1439496,"We were trying to get a loan modification through Nationstar Mortgage. Every time we sent in the documents they requested they would say they did n't receive them, they were incorrect, or they needed more documentation. It was very hard to get anyone to give you an answer about your status. It was just always ... send more documentation. Just after XXXX in XXXX of 2015 we were out of town so we sent our brother up to check on the house only to find our doorknob ripped off and another lock put on with a lockbox. It took several attempts to get Nationstar to tell us that they had hired a company to go in and secure the home. The only thing is that they did it completely illegally. They had not foreclosed and taken possession legally. Then even more ridiculous is the fact that Nationstar then gave us the code to get in to our home. When we entered the house we quickly found it to be very cold even though the thermostats were set high. While trying to figure out what the issue was with the heat we noticed that every door in the house had been opened, and not only that but cupboards, and even personal dressers and drawers had been gone through. We went to the utility room and found that they had shut down the boiler that heats all XXXX sq ft of our home and this was in XXXX in the XXXX in Ut. After the cops arrived we went through the home together and had found that both of our wedding rings had been stolen along with XXXX that we had collected. There very well could have been other things missing but these were blatantly obvious and very personal! Nationstar quickly said they were not responsible because they had hired the other company. Lawyers have told us that they are totally liable because they are responsible for sending them to our home but the only hope they gave us was to file a civil law suit. We obviously do n't have the money for an expensive law suit as we were already working on trying to save our home. I find it very disturbing that these companies are so disorganized, manipulating and operate outside of their legal rights without any repercussion! We tried to get a modification offer for almost a year and they never offered one. We had told them we would opt for a deed in lieu, or a short sale before we would let the home foreclose but shortly after we pushed the legality of their actions we received a foreclosure notice to sell on the XX/XX/XXXX.We had to hire a lawyer to try to help us get it stopped and they were as deceptive with them as they were with us. In the end we had to borrow almost {$200000.00} in family money to save our home from foreclosure and now we are right back in the same mess we started in. We even contacted the county courthouse that was supposed to be over the sale, and it was only stopped 2 days before the sale, but the courthouse said they did n't know anything about a sale on that day. But they all seemed to know about a foreclosure auction on the XXXX of XXXX. I do n't know what they were up to or what they had cooked up but the whole thing seemed questionable to us. Our lawyer also requested a payoff in writing for reinstatement that we could count on before we paid all of that money but we could n't get them to email, fax or send XXXX in any form. We finally had to pay blindly hoping that the amount they quoted was correct. As soon as the banker wired the money they told our lawyer that they missed the amount by {$1200.00}. We were passed the payoff for the day and it took a XXXX way conference call to get it straight but we spent the night wondering what they would say the next day.

The Bank knows that the Caretakers sole income was a stipend he earned as Caretaker, which the Trust stopped paying after the XXXX of the XXXX. The Caretaker is the primary beneficiary of the Trust.
The Bank has unfairly and unreasonably delayed closing the Trust and disbursing the remaining funds to the beneficiaries of the Trust. The Bank has also refused to reimburse the Caretaker for trust expenses the Caretaker paid out of pocket over the last decade. The Bank misled the Caretaker by indicating it would reimburse his expenses after paying a healthcare lien, yet the lien was paid in  XXXX XXXX and the Bank has not reimbursed the trust expenses paid by the Caretaker. 

In addition, the Bank refuses to communicate with the Caretaker about basic daily administrative items such as vehicle and home insurance for Trust assets. Caretaker lives in a home owned by the Trust and drove a vehicle owned by the Trust until he was forced to report it as a planned non-operational vehicle based on a lack of communication from the Bank about auto insurance. 

The Bank is unreasonably and wrongfully delaying disbursement of the Trust proceeds to the beneficiaries. It is unfairly maintaining control of Trust assets and has made deceptive representations about reimbursing the Caretaker. The Bank is required to file a final accounting in order to dissolve the Trust, has not done so over nine months after the XXXX of the Decedent, and ignores all inquiries about when the document will be filed.

The resolution process switched from a short sale to a modification. 
As of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I was informed that there was no sale date scheduled. 
Although all documents are received by SLS and underwriting has started I am told that the date of sale leaves no time to evaluate my situation. 
SLS has been unable to contact me directly as the phone numbers on file were incorrect SLS has not had an up to date appraisal and is seriously overvaluing the property.

The next counter was {$150000.00}, and now in XXXX of XXXX I 'm being told the lowest they will accept is {$130000.00}.

Where is the regulation on valuations? Why is it we can show proof our house can not fetch the value they want and they are allowed to force a homeowner to foreclosure? At what point over a period of almost two years does the lender realize the home value is not worth their required price? Why are n't we as homeowners allowed copies of their valuations? We are required to get an appraisal to get a loan, so why are n't we privy to valuations when they foreclose on our homes?

Since my loan has been sold, I have had no assistance with SLS.

- Creditor : XXXX XXXX XXXX On XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, I contacted XXXX customer care and was informed by a representative that I did not owe any outstanding debt. I returned the vehicle in perfect condition on the past few occasions when I rented a vehicle through XXXX, and no additional charges were mentioned at the time of return ( receipts of payments attached ). 

Despite this, Viking Client Services has contacted me, claiming that I owe XXXX a debt. This claim is incorrect and may result from a clerical error or miscommunication between the entities involved. Furthermore, I have not received any communication from XXXX XXXX XXXX regarding any outstanding payment, which leads me to believe that the debt is not legitimate. 

Additionally, the letter from Viking Client Services does not provide any details about the charge, such as the nature of the alleged debt or any specific transaction details. This lack of information further complicates my ability to verify the claim 's validity. I have requested verification of the debt from Viking Client Services but have not received adequate proof to substantiate their claims. 

I am concerned that this erroneous debt collection attempt is not only causing undue stress but may also potentially harm my credit rating. I believe these actions violate the FDCPA and request the CFPB 's assistance in investigating and resolving this matter.

I kindly request that the CFPB take the following actions : 1. Investigate the debt collection practices of Viking Client Services concerning this matter.

3209788,"On XX/XX/2019 at XXXX XXXX ( 31 mins ), XXXX XXXX ( 2 mins ), XXXX XXXX ( 1 min ), and XXXX XXXX ( 16 mins ) I called my mortgage company Mr. Copper. I spoke with XXXX ( ext # XXXX ) in regards to a letter I received in the mail. The letter has a statement date of XX/XX/2019. In the letter it states that I have to pay {$80.00} to my escrow account by XX/XX/2019 to have a monthly payment of {$990.00}. Mr. Copper calls that option 1. That is an increase from my past monthly payment of {$980.00}. Option 2 is to have the escrow shortage divided for 12 months and my new monthly payment will increase to {$1000.00}. I paid {$90.00} on XX/XX/2019 to my escrow account to have my monthly payment be option 1 of a monthly payment of {$990.00} and yet my monthly payment increased to {$1000.00}. 

The reason for the call was ensure if I place {$1000.00} in my escrow account would it decrease my monthly payment. When speaking to XXXX she told me that was not possible. I told her I would like to see a copy of Mr. Copper 's policy on escrow accounts and would also I like to speak with her supervisor. The supervisor name is XXXX ( employee # XXXX ), she gave an analogy of the escrow account being like a bank checking account. She said, "" If you escrow account is in the negative, then the increase in the monthly payment increases to cover the projected escrow cost. '' I then said, "" If that is so then if I transfer {$1000.00} my escrow account then my monthly payment should decrease. '' She told me that is not correct and the escrow account could not have a positive amount and I would receive a refund the following monthly. I then ask if she could send me Mr. Copper 's policy on escrow accounts, a document in writing where it clearly states that as being the company policy. 

It is now XX/XX/2019 and I have not received Mr. Copper 's policy on escrow accounts and that is my chief complaint. 

My secondary complaint is that I paid {$90.00} to my escrow account on XX/XX/2019 to have my monthly payment of {$990.00} and it still increased to {$1000.00}. 

This occurred to me last year as well. I paid the required escrow payment and my monthly payment increased anyways. I am sure if Mr. Copper is doing this to me they are doing it to other people.

I stopped getting monthly statements from CitiMortgage and started getting them from a company called XXXX. We tried to do a modification with them, but were denied for different reasons, and then they said that they were going to foreclose without offering any other options such as putting what we owed on the back of the mortgage because they said what we owed was {$30000.00} which means @ {$580.00} a month, we would n't have paid for at least 7 years which is untrue. XXXX said that the house went to auction XX/XX/XXXX, but no one bought it. They continued to send us statements until XX/XX/XXXX.

16371948,"I. Nature of Dispute I am formally disputing the reporting of a XXXX  collection account allegedly assigned to Diversified Adjustment Service and appearing on my credit reports with XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. XXXX and Diversified Adjustment have failed to provide any evidence or verification that I owe this alleged {$99.00} debt. Therefore, this account is unverifiable, inaccurate, and unlawfully reported under federal law. II. FCRA Violations 1. FCRA 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) Failure to Provide Verification Under 15 U.S.C. 1681g, a consumer reporting agency must provide all information in the consumers file upon request, including the source of the information. Neither XXXX nor Diversified Adjustment has provided a signed contract, account statement, billing record, or other written evidence proving this debt belongs to me. If no verifiable documentation exists showing my legal obligation, this entry is unverifiable and must be deleted immediately. 2. FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Reinvestigation All three bureaus are required to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation when a consumer disputes an account. Simply accepting Diversifieds word without verifying documentation or proof of contract constitutes a sham investigation ( as defined in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) ). You can not legally verify an account that lacks documentation, signatures, or original creditor validation. 3. FCRA 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) Furnishing Inaccurate Information Diversified Adjustment and XXXX  have knowingly continued reporting an unverified debt. That is a direct violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ), which prohibits furnishers from reporting inaccurate or unverifiable information to consumer reporting agencies. The CFPB has fined major furnishers for exactly this behavior including XXXX  ( {$15.00} XXXX, XXXX ) for improper reinvestigations, and XXXX  ( {$23.00} XXXX, XXXX ) for failing to ensure accuracy in data furnished to credit bureaus. 4. FCRA 604 ( a ) Lack of Permissible Purpose If Diversified or XXXX accessed my credit report without a valid debt or signed authorization, they violated 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( f ) by obtaining my credit information without permissible purpose. III. XXXX XXXX and Consumer Data Accuracy Violations The XXXX XXXX Compliance Guidelines, governed by the Consumer Data Industry Association ( CDIA ), require that furnishers : Report accurate, complete, and verifiable data ( XXXX XXXX, Field 23 & 25 Standards ) ; Delete unverifiable accounts ; and Not report accounts in dispute without an investigation outcome ( CDIA, 1.2.3 ). Yet the bureaus are reporting inconsistent data : XXXX  shows Account In Dispute Reported by Subscriber ( FCBA ) ; XXXX  shows Collection Account ; XXXX  shows Unpaid ; These inconsistent statuses violate XXXX XXXX uniform reporting standards and demonstrate that this account has not been verified. IV. FDCPA & Consumer Law Violations by Diversified Adjustment As a third-party debt collector, Diversified Adjustment is bound by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S.C. 1692 et seq. Under 1692g ( b ), upon written dispute, the collector must cease all collection and reporting activity until debt validation is provided. Diversified Adjustment failed to comply they continue to report this debt after receiving notice of dispute, constituting continued collection activity without validation, a direct FDCPA violation. -- - V. FTC and CFPB Enforcement Precedents Regulators have repeatedly penalized credit bureaus and furnishers for sham investigations and failure to verify disputed accounts, including : XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) {$15.00} XXXX fine for improper dispute handling and reinvestigations. XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$23.00} XXXX fine for repeated failure to ensure accuracy of reported data. XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXX ( XXXX ) Liability for relying on automated systems without meaningful investigation. XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) Sanctions for deceptive and inaccurate reporting practices. These cases establish that a certification of accuracy is not a valid reinvestigation actual documentation and consumer consent are required. VI. Demands for XXXX XXXX I hereby demand the following actions be taken within 15 days of receipt of this notice : XXXX. XXXX deletion of this unverifiable XXXX / Diversified Adjustment account from all three credit reports ( XXXX XXXX, and XXXX  ) . 2. Provide complete documentation verifying the alleged debt, including : The original signed agreement with XXXX  ; Billing records or statements proving liability and amount owed ; Proof of assignment or sale to Diversified Adjustment. 3. Cease and desist from further reporting, collection, or sale of this account. 4. Provide written confirmation that this account has been permanently deleted from all consumer reporting databases. VII. Notice of Legal Intent If this account is not deleted or verified with proper documentation, I will file : A formal enforcement complaint with the CFPB, FTC, and Maryland Attorney General ; A civil claim under FCRA 1681n and 1681o for willful and negligent noncompliance, seeking statutory, actual, and punitive damages, attorneys fees, and costs ; A private action under FDCPA 1692k for continued collection activity on an unverified debt.

Subject : Dispute of Inaccurate Information on Credit Report Dear TransUnion, I hope this letter finds you well.

Firstly, I would like to draw your attention to 15 US code 1681 A, B and 42 USC Sec. 48, which expressly state that I never provided verbal or written consent to ANYONE or ANY Agency to furnish my information or allow anyone else to obtain my information. Therefore, any information obtained without my consent is in violation of federal regulations. Additionally, I would like to reference 15 US code 1692 and 15 US code 1666B, which address abusive collections practices in which you continuously aide these collection agencies and financial institutions in these egregious practices that violate my Rights. I believe that the late payments and inaccuracies reported on my credit report are not only misleading but also preventing me from accessing funding to secure my family that I am entitled to as a responsible borrower.

Furthermore, if I am indeed the original creditor per consumer law, it is important to note that it is against the law to transfer any contract, as stated in 15 US 1692a ( 4 ) and Sec 1692e # 6 A and B. Any transfer of my contract without my knowledge or consent would be a violation of my rights. As you have continued to aide these companies in these practices, according to 18 US Code 1028A this is Aggravated Identity Theft because you share and use my personal information for credit reporting without my written or verbal permission.

I kindly request that you immediately remove these negative accounts and take appropriate action to rectify the inaccuracies and Federal Violations on my credit report.

5919939,"My name is XXXX XXXX. I currently live in XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Several years ago, my husband and I purchased a house located at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, XXXX for the purpose of allowing our daughter to live there. She made the mortgage payments and XXXX XXXX XXXX  payments as her rent. We paid the initial down payment, mortgage fees and closing costs. After that we never received any income from or paid any further expenses toward the house, but we were the legal owners. The initial mortgage was through XXXX, but it was later sold to Mr. Cooper Home Loans as of XX/XX/XXXX. My husband died on XX/XX/XXXX. I immediately sent a copy of his death certificate to Mr. Cooper informing the company of his death. Because we owned the property as tenants by the entirety, I became the sole owner of the property upon his death, and no one else held any interest in the property. 

In XXXX of XXXX my daughter residing in the property bought the house from me and the Mr. Cooper mortgage was paid off. On XX/XX/XXXX, nearly three months after the payoff, Mr. Cooper mailed me a check in the amount of {$1400.00}. I took the check to my bank to deposit, but was told I could not deposit it because it was made out to The Estate of XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, and no account for The Estate of XXXX XXXX XXXX existed. My husband had no estate account. His assets, our home also owned as tenants by the entirety, automatically went to me, our only motor vehicle was in my name, and I was the named beneficiary to his IRA account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Mr. Cooper and was eventually connected to someone named XXXX in XXXX XXXX sounded like he was eating his lunch while talking to me. I explained the situation and told him I needed them to stop payment on the check they sent me and send another made to me alone. At first he argued they couldnt do that. It was company policy to do it the way they did. I said so I cant get the money owed me? He said yes, and I said well I cant deposit it as written. Would you like to talk to my bank? When I started pushing him to talk to my bank he changed his tune and started furiously typing on his keyboard, eventually telling me he had taken care of it and I should receive a new check within 14 business days. I waited three weeks, and when no check was received I called again and spoke with someone named XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Again, I explained the situation and was told again he had taken care of it and I should receive the revised check in 5-7 business days. That time period passed and no check appeared. I was scheduled to go on a trip beginning XX/XX/XXXX, and I put a hold on my mail until XX/XX/XXXX. Upon my return home and receipt of my held mail there was still no check for the {$1400.00}. During all this I also received a check for {$23.00}, which I mailed back to the company with a note explaining that check as well had to be made out to me only. In my held mail they had sent me a replacement check for {$23.00}, but it was still made out To the Estate of XXXX XXXX XXXX and myself. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called the company again and asked to speak with someone in management. I was eventually connected to XXXX XXXX of the Executive Resolutions Team of Mr. Cooper. She listened to my complaint and assured me she could deposit the money directly in my account within 10 days. She just needed me to email her pictures of the two voided checks that read To the Estate of and a picture of a voided personal check to make the deposit. She emailed me her name and number but made no comments in the email. I return emailed her an attachment of pictures of the three voided checks. She said she would keep me informed of when those checks were voided there and she could make my deposit. When I had not heard from her by the XXXX, I emailed her to ask if there was a problem. I received no response. On XX/XX/XXXX, eight days after my initial contact with her, I emailed her again asking for an update. I received no response.

6980547,"We bought our house on XXXX XXXX XXXX, with XXXX XXXX.  Unfortunately, our mortgage was sold to Freedom Mortgage right away.  We never made one payment to XXXX, we have always made the payments to Freedom Mortgage.  When our mortgage was sold, my husband and I read their 1.7 star reviews and knew that this was not a reputable company, but seemingly, we were stuck with them.  In hindsight, I wish we somehow fought for Freedom not to take over our mortgage because dealing with them has been an ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE.  Our original mortgage payment was XXXX, including our escrow account for taxes, homeowners insurance, and our PMI.  Unfortunately, I cannot attach an original statement because their website only goes back 6 months and doesnt allow you to see any payment history prior to that.  In XXXX XXXX, we received our mortgage statement with a new payment of XXXX due in XXXX  (see attached of XXXX  statement.) On XXXX XXXX, we received a letter from them (attached) stating that they had previously sent us an escrow check in the amount of XXXX, as well as an escrow analysis.  In the letter it stated that if we didnt receive this, to call them and they would reissue the check.  I called them on XXXX XXXX XXXX, told them we never received that, and they told us they would issue another check to us and it would take 7-10 business days.  We never received that, so I called back on XXXX XXXX.  The woman I spoke with said whoever handled it previously never submitted it, and she would take care of that now and it would take another 7-10 business days.  
On XXXX XXXX, my husband called them since we still hadnt received this elusive escrow check.  The woman he spoke with told him that the escrow check was canceled because now our account was showing an escrow deficit, so not only would we not receive the check, but our mortgage payment was increasing to XXXX.  There was no prior communication of this and we would have never known if we hadnt called them.  We did receive an Escrow Account Disclosure Statement dated XXXX XXXX (attached) that explained this, but we didnt receive this until XXXX XXXX, over a month later.  When my husband got off the phone after 18 minutes, I called them back because I was not satisfied with the explanation given.  I was on the phone for 59 minutes talking with a woman who explained that when our taxes were analyzed, they werent analyzed for county taxes, only town taxes.  I went through our closing disclosure (attached) and explained that it states county and town taxes were included, and that there is a XXXX  estimate of XXXX for both the county and town tax (attached.) (When I called the tax office, our town and county taxes are paid together, as one fee.)  On our closing disclosure, it states that the town property taxes are XXXX a month and our county taxes are XXXX per month.  When I explained this on the phone, the woman said that something seems off with the account and she isnt sure what happened, so she was going to have it audited and put it in for review herself.  Again, we were told we would hear back in 7-10 business days.  
	On XXXX XXXX XXXX, someone from Freedom Mortgage did call me (for the first and only time since this started) and I missed the call so I called back.  I spoke to a man who explained our escrow analysis was incorrect for XXXX  and thats why we were in a deficit.  He blamed this on XXXX, stating that this is what they received from XXXX  when they acquired the mortgage, but according to our closing disclosure, XXXX  did their job and estimated the taxes.  I have also attached the Initial Escrow Account Disclosure Statement from XXXX  for XXXX XXXX-XXXX XXXX.  On this sheet, it states that our payments to the escrow account would be XXXX a month, resulting in our original XXXX mortgage payment.  After that document, I have also included the portion of Freedom Mortgages Escrow Account Disclosure Statement that shows their projections for XXXX XXXX-XXXX XXXX, showing our escrow payment to be XXXX.  That is almost XXXX less in projected escrow payments.  Freedom Mortgage clearly analyzed our taxes incorrectly, tried to place the blame on another mortgage company, and then we had to pay for their mistake so our mortgage payment went up. 
In that same call, the man I spoke with also told me that an XXXX payment had been applied to our account on XXXX XXXX, the same day I had previously called to discuss the escrow check, and that our payment of XXXX, not the new amount of XXXX was due in XXXX.  XXXX  payment had already been applied to our account, which was also reflected on their website.  I asked him to tell me which account that XXXX payment came from because neither my husband, nor myself had made that payment, he said he is not authorized to tell me which account it came from.  My husbands uncle knows our account information and has paid money towards our mortgage before, and we had assumed this was the case.  This was an incorrect assumption on our part that Freedom Mortgage would apply money to the correct account being that all of the account information had to be on the screen, including our loan number and names.  We received a letter (attached) on XXXX XXXX dated XXXX XXXX confirming the above payment.  It is our loan number, however, not our last 4 digits of our bank account, which I stated in that phone call.  
	On XXXX XXXX, I called to ask why our mortgage payment was XXXX instead of the XXXX that I was told it would be on XXXX XXXX and why on their website it still says that we owe XXXX.  I was told because of our escrow deficit, but I explained that we were told on the phone of XXXX XXXX our XXXX  payment would be XXXX.  We then received two letters on XXXX XXXX dated XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX respectively (attached.) The first letter states they have been trying to contact us about our account.  I have not received more than one phone call from them, nor any voicemail.  The one I had received was the missed call that I previously stated. At this point, I had contact them so many times that if they needed to discuss anything about my account, they had many opportunities.  The second letter states that our account is 2 payments past due and to call them.  When I called them on XXXX XXXX to ask how this is possible, because we have never missed a mortgage payment, let alone been late on one, the woman told me the XXXX was rescinded and applied to the correct account.  I explained that I said it didnt come from our accounts when we were told about it.  She told me that it was a huge error on their part because in order to apply a payment to my account, all of my information, including our loan number, needs to be on the screen.  Again, I was told that she would look into it and we would hear back in 7-10 business days.  Our XXXX  payment was drafted from our account on XXXX XXXX XXXX, so at this point, we were only 30 days behind because of that XXXX payment. We then received a letter dated XXXX XXXX (AFTER I called the previous day) saying they have assigned us a single point of contact.  This has been of zero help because every time I do call, no one knows what the last person said.  I have to ask everyone to go back in the notes and listen to the recordings.  
	Since we had not heard back, yet again, my husband and I called on XXXX XXXX and were on the phone with them for 111 minutes.  We were first connected with a woman named XXXX, and we asked immediately to speak to a manager.  We explained the entire story to the manager and she said that she would apply the XXXX back to our account to take care of it. We told her not to do that, it wasnt our money, and it was just going to make more of a mess.  She finally understood that we were concerned because of their mistake, now we are considered late in our mortgage and it is going onto our credit report as a late payment of 30 days, plus we are being charged late fees on top of that.  She was able to get it off our credit report for XXXX  (attached) since it was their error, but then told us to just go ahead and make another mortgage payment to get us caught up.  I told her that since our XXXX  payment was already drafted, we didnt have the money to make another mortgage payment 6 days later.  She told me that there was nothing else she could do, so again, I asked for it to be escalated.  I was put in contact with someone named XXXX.  I explained the entire situation again, and XXXX  told me that she would try to get it deferred to the end of our mortgage since it was their error so we wouldnt be considered late on our credit and we wouldnt need to pay late fees.  Again, we were told we would hear back in 7-10 business days.
	On XXXX XXXX, not having heard back from them again, I called and immediately asked it to be escalated.  I was put in touch with XXXX XXXX XXXX, who is apparently a supervisor for the loss mitigation department. She told me that since this was their mistake, she was going to try to bypass the regular application for deferred payments. XXXX  said she wanted to get in touch with XXXX  from my previous conversation to get all of the details correct. Again, I was told we would hear in 7-10 business days.
	On XXXX XXXX, I yet again had to call them.  I asked to speak to XXXX  and gave her ID number.  She was in training that day, but I was told they put a message in the system for her to call me.  I was also told that our concern was in underwriting, but that I needed to respond by a certain date and since I hadnt, they had to submit it again.  I was told that if Im not notified that I have to respond, how would I ever know that and I was also told that someone would call me.  I was told again, I would hear in 7-10 business days.
	On XXXX XXXX I called back and spoke to a man who again, put in a request for XXXX  to call me back.  He said he understood my frustration and hopefully they could get to the bottom of this.
	On XXXX XXXX I called again.  I was told that I did receive a call on XXXX XXXX  I went through my phone logs and didnt see a missed call from them, nor did I have any voicemail from them.  I explained that now we are in the process of trying to finance our car since our lease is up and we cannot get financing because we have two payments on our credit report of 30 days late.  I said that this is completely ruining our credit and in turn, our livelihood.  Before this, we both had great credit.  He went through the notes and explained to me that in order for the payment to be deferred, it has to be more than 30 days late.  I was NEVER told this before.  In order for that to happen, he wanted us to stop our automatic payment due to come out XXXX XXXX XXXX  so that way it would be considered more than 30 days late and then it can be deferred.  We absolutely cannot do this.  Two 30 day late payments have already significantly damaged our credit, we cannot have it damaged even further.  
We need this resolved and taken off our credit report immediately.  It is harming our livelihood, and they have gotten away with this for too long.  Dealing with anyone at this company is a disgrace.  My husband wanted me to escalate this back in XXXX, but I kept telling him to let them make it right.  I should have listened to him because this is going on 6 months of no communication between the employees who work there, no communication between Freedom Mortgage and the customer, the employees do not seem to understand what they are doing, they all give you the runaround, they dont call you back, they dont communicate information, there are grave mistakes made.  There are no notes on their website, any letter we have received from them comes an untimely two-three weeks after its dated.  All of these conversations I have had with them are all well documented because they record every conversation.  It says at the beginning of the call and I asked them because I have asked them to go through the recorded calls.  They all seem to agree on one thing: that it was their error in the first place, but no one can do anything to help you.  We have been patient enough and have given them the benefit of the doubt, but now we are escalating this in every way we possibly can.
Thank you,

On top of that, I was never notified nor contacted by phone, email or USPS mail with a copy of this lease extension by Hyundai Finance.

XX/XX/XXXX He contacts Hyundai Finance and was informed that I needed to sign the lease extension and thats why the vehicle was repossessed. He is also told that Hyundai had attempted to contact him by phone but that they are not allowed to leave messages due to privacy laws. My son was unaware of any such calls ( as he does not pick up calls from unknown numbers especially with the proliferation of spam calls everyone receives these days ) and never received an e-mail from Hyundai Finance regarding any issue.

My son asks to speak to a manager and is told it would take 72 hours for a one to get back to him. 72 hours pass and no one contacts him. In fact, its now been over a month days and hes yet to receive a call from a manager. He contacts Hyundai at least half-a-dozen times and gets nowhere. Hes told his only option is to purchase the vehicle outright and pay all of the repo fees. 
XX/XX/XXXX I contact Hyundai Finance several times and speaks with 4 or 5 reps and gets nowhere. All of the Hyundai reps are completely dismissive. I also ask to speak with a manager but never receives a call back. I then contacts Hyundai Customer Relations and opens up a Complaint Case ( Case # : XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX I call to follow up on his case and is told there is no update and is then directed to call Hyundais repossession depart who inform them that there is no way they will reverse this repo order.

He signed the six-month lease extension with Hyundai Finance as instructed and made every payment on time. He was actually planning on returning the vehicle prior to XX/XX/XXXX and leasing a new Hyundai. He's now been without a car for four weeks. He has been embarrassed, treated like a criminal by Hyundai and has had his and my credit destroyed. He cant even buy or lease a new vehicle right now because of this. Its apparent to us that there is a serious communication issue within Hyundai Finance for which we should not be punished. We firmly believe that their finance department is acting in a criminal manner by deciding to bleed out every last dime from XXXX before taking his car four weeks early after receiving the sixth and final payment of the lease extension.

2806049,"PennyMac Loan Services LLC received my mortgage payment on XX/XX/XXXX. It is now Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX and PennyMac has not yet credited my mortgage account. PennyMac has held my payment, without crediting my account, for 8 business days. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX from my current loan servicer, PennyMac Loan Services , LLC . This letter states the following : effective XX/XX/XXXX, the servicing of my mortgage loan is being transferred from PennyMac Loan Services , LLC (  PennyMac ) to XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX. This means that after this date, XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX, will be collecting your mortgage loan payments from you. Nothing else about your mortgage loan will change. 
The letter also states that : Under federal law, during the 60-day period following the effective date of the transfer of the loan servicing, a loan payment received by PennyMac on or before its due date may not be treated by XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX as late, and a late fee may not be imposed on you. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX  EST, I contacted PennyMac by phone and spoke with XXXX. I explained to her that I need to make a payment. I stated that if I did not receive my new account number and mortgage statement from the new loan servicer, I would send my next payment to PennyMac. XXXX stated that I could send the payment to PennyMac and they would forward it to XXXX XXXX XXXX, if I didnt receive a mortgage statement from XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX EST, I contacted the new loan servicer, XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX and spoke to XXXX. XXXX stated that they did not have my information yet and that the loan will have a new loan number after it transfers to XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX stated that I will receive a welcome letter by XX/XX/XXXX, the date of the transfer. XXXX also stated that in order to receive a mortgage statement I will have to make a payment over the phone first or by mail, and then after my first payment the mortgage statements will be generated. I stated to XXXX that I will continue to make payments to PennyMac until I receive a mortgage payment from XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

By XX/XX/XXXX, I still had not received any letters from XXXX XXXX XXXX regarding my mortgage account with them. I had no mortgage statement and I did not have any payment coupon nor did I have the new account number from XXXX XXXX XXXX. As a result, I mailed the mortgage payment to PennyMac via USPS priority mail express ( the same way I have being mailing payments to PennyMac in the past 2-3 years ). As per USPS, my mortgage payment was delivered to Penny Mac on XX/XX/XXXX, and signed by XXXX XXXX ( see Attachments 1 and 2 ). 

On Saturday XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX XXXX XXXX and I spoke to XXXX to see the status of my account and he informed me that they just received the file from PennyMac the day before. XXXX stated that I was not in their system yet. XXXX stated that it takes a few days for the PennyMac file to load in their system but that by Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX my account should be in the system. I stated to XXXX that since I never received a mortgage statement or any correspondence from XXXX XXXX XXXX, I sent the mortgage payment to Penny Mac.  XXXX stated that Penny Mac will be forwarding the payment to XXXX XXXX XXXX. It is now Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX and I have not received any correspondence from XXXX  XXXX XXXX. 

I called PennyMac on XX/XX/XXXX to find out why they had not posted the check that they received on XX/XX/XXXX. I was able to speak with a customer service representative named XXXX. I asked him why, after receiving my payment, they decided not to credit the account. He answered that they had not yet received my payment. I replied to him this is not true and that I have the USPS ( US Postal Service ) tracking information which shows that the letter was delivered to PennyMac and signed for by XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX ( see Attachments 1 and 2 ). The representative then stated that it takes 7-10 business days to credit the account. I stated to the representative that this is also not true. In the past, after the payment is received, the check has posted to my account in less than 3 business day. For example, in XX/XX/XXXX, I mailed a payment, via USPS, on XX/XX/XXXX ( see Attachments 3 and 4 ). As per the USPS tracking information, the XXXX letter was delivered to PennyMac and signed for by XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX ( see Attachment 4 ). The check for the XX/XX/XXXX payment posted to my bank account on XX/XX/XXXX ( see Attachment 5 ). The XX/XX/XXXX payment was credited by PennyMac, to my account, within 2 business days after receiving the payment.

I believe that PennyMac is not crediting my account in order to be able to foreclose on my home. In the past PennyMac has made many attempts to foreclose on my home. I have filed several complaints against them with the CFPB. I am behind on my payments and I am in the process of catching up. I believe that PennyMac is now working in conjunction with the new servicer, XXXX  XXXX XXXX, to avoid crediting my account. By not crediting my account PennyMac will cause my account to reach 120 days past due and they will be able to foreclose on my home.

11296096,"XX/XX/XXXX Subject : Request for Description of Investigation Process - Disputed Accounts on My Credit Report Dear CFPB, I am writing to formally request a detailed description of the investigation process followed by your agency regarding the disputed accounts on my credit report. Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 USC 1681i ( a ) ( 7 ), credit reporting agencies are obligated to provide a description of the investigation within 15 days of receiving a consumer 's dispute. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I initiated a dispute concerning inaccuracies on my credit report related to late payments on the following account : Account Information : Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX High Balance : {$2000.00} Credit Limit : {$1500.00} Last Verified : XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) Date of Last Activity : XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX XXXX Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) Balance Owed : {$1100.00} Account Status : Closed Payment Status : Current Creditor Remarks : Account closed by credit grantor ( XXXX XXXX ; Account closed due to inactivity ( Experian ) Two-Year Payment History : XXXX : Late payments for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX Experian : Late payments for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX XXXX : Late payments for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX Upon my review, I identified discrepancies in the reported late payments. According to my records, all payments were made on time and in full. I believe the account should reflect a status of "" Paid As Agreed Never Late. '' Supporting Legal Citations : Under 15 USC 1681e ( b ), credit reporting agencies are required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure maximum accuracy of the information reported. 
Per 15 USC 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), upon notification of a dispute, credit reporting agencies must reinvestigate the disputed information and report the results within 30 days.

Additionally, under 15 USC 1681s-2 ( a ), furnishers of information are prohibited from reporting information they know or have reasonable cause to believe is inaccurate.

Per 15 USC 1666 ( b ) and section 1637 ( b ) of Title 15, periodic statements must be mailed to consumers not later than 21 days before the payment due date and include all required information. 
Details of Errors : The alleged late payments reported by XXXX, Experian, and XXXX do not align with my payment records. My bank statements clearly show timely payments for the months in question. 
XXXX reported late payments for XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, while XXXX and Experian reported late payments for XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. These discrepancies are clear violations of 15 USC 1681e ( b ) as they reflect inaccurate and inconsistent information across the credit bureaus. 
No communication or notifications were provided to me regarding any alleged late payments, as required under 15 USC 1666 ( a ).

Request for Action : Conduct a reinvestigation of the reported late payments on this account.

Update the account status to accurately reflect "" Paid As Agreed Never Late. '' Provide a written description of the reasonable procedures used during your investigation as required under 15 USC 1681i ( a ) ( 7 ). 
Supply verifiable proof of the alleged late payments, including specific dates, amounts, and communication supporting the claim.

Provide compliance documentation regarding periodic statements, ensuring statements were sent at least 21 days before payment due dates.

Reference to PAANL ( Paid As Agreed Never Late ) : The terms of our agreement have always been adhered to, and the account in question should reflect a status of "" Paid As Agreed Never Late '' based on the timely payments made. It is imperative that my credit report accurately represents my financial responsibility and commitment to meeting payment obligations. 
If you can not verify the accuracy of the reported late payments or provide the requested documentation, I demand that the erroneous information be promptly removed or corrected to reflect accurate reporting. Failure to comply with the obligations set forth under the FCRA will compel me to escalate this matter by filing complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and other relevant authorities. 
Enclosed, I have included a copy of my payment records and relevant documentation that further support my claim. I look forward to your timely response and resolution within the 30-day period stipulated by the FCRA.

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, XXXX emailed a complete loan modification application ( "" the XXXX XXXX application '' ) on behalf of XXXX, to Chase 's legal counsel and directly to Chase rep., XXXX XXXX, as requested by Chase and approved by Chase 's counsel. ( Exhibit A ). Around XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, the borrower received a missing documents letter. XXXX emailed the requested documents to Chase 's counsel and XXXX XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, Chase 's counsel emailed XXXX a letter denying XXXX for a Chase Modification, on the grounds that Chase was "" not able to create an affordable payment equal to the required percentage of the [ the borrower 's ] reported monthly gross income without changing the terms of [ the borrower 's ] mortgage beyond the modification program 's requirements. '' This same letter denied XXXX for a Chase Modification with Principal Forgiveness because Chase "" could not verify [ XXXX 's ] income, employment, assets, identity, and/or property occupancy. '' ( Exhibit B ). XXXX, believing these reasons to be both improper and contradictory, appealed this on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. ( Exhibit C ). 
After XXXX submitted the appeal, XXXX XXXX of XXXX had two phone conversations with Chase rep. XXXX XXXX. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX informed XXXX XXXX that the denial was based on Chase 's inability to verify XXXX 's income, employment and occupancy. XXXX 's income and employment had been clearly documented in the application ; the application had also explicitly stated that XXXX does not live in the subject property, and that it is a second home in which his mother and sister live. The documents submitted with the XXXX XXXX application confirmed this. During a second telephone conversation on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX stated that the XXXX XXXX application was not reviewed because an earlier application submitted by or on behalf of the borrower incorrectly stated it was his primary residence. As noted to XXXX XXXX, XXXX did not submit this application. Despite any error in the previous application, his nonoccupancy in the property was made abundantly clear in the XXXX XXXX application. XXXX XXXX stated that the entire RMA could not be verified the file was closed. 
At a foreclosure settlement conference on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, Chase 's counsel admitted that the denial was a "" streamline denial. '' She confirmed that the denial was not based on any information in the XXXX XXXX application because Chase had not actually reviewed it. The court directed that Chase review the XXXX XXXX application. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, Chase 's counsel emailed XXXX stating that Chase would not review the application, and instead requested an entirely new application be submitted on behalf of XXXX. 
Chase 's admitted and repeated refusal to review the complete loan modification application is a flagrant violation of RESPA 's loss mitigation rules. Pursuant to RESPA 's loss mitigation rules, upon receipt of a loss mitigation application, a servicer must determine if the application is either complete or incomplete and notify the borrower of its determination "" in writing within 5 days.

4607341,"M & T Bank failed to pay my homeowner 's insurance from my fully paid escrow account. I was notified the payment was late on XX/XX/XXXX and my insurance policy was cancelled by XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, leaving me uninsured. During those 5 weeks I spent much effort and time calling both M & T and my insurer. Three times M & T assured me the check had been sent, only for the customer service rep I spoke with on a follow-up call to tell me that check had been "" cancelled by the system. '' There was no accountability and nobody could identify the cause. 

To further complicate things, each time I called M & T 's customer service line and navigated the phone tree, once I chose "" escrow '' I simply received a recorded message that a check had already been sent, with no option to speak to a person. I tried many options to try and get around this roadblock, and finally had to *pretend to have a different problem. * I had to choose "" trouble with an insurance claim '' to get a person, after which I begged them to transfer me to someone who could help. 

In a panicked 3-way call on XX/XX/XXXX a M & T Bank customer rep informed me that "" we don't do escrow for co-ops. '' I told her I had been issued an escrow mortgage by M & T itself seven years ago and had paid faithfully, and the online payment portal has a separate line-item for escrow. She repeated that I now had a "" non-escrow mortgage. '' There was no explanation for the change and no one had informed me of it prior to it being effected. 

To add insult to injury, once she dropped off the call a customer service satisfaction survey recording kicked in. I was almost crying as I begged the other rep not to hang up as the interminable, chirpy recording played twice through. I was afraid the call would auto-disconnect when it was done. 

I was assured that THIS TIME a check would go out to XXXX XXXX. I was assured I would also receive a refund check for additional paid escrow. I said I wanted this all in writing because I had talked to many people and they all had told me different things. I said, "" Okay so now I wait for the check to go to XXXX XXXX, I wait for a refund to me, and I wait for a letter explaining what happened, and I also no longer pay escrow, right? '' The second rep waited while I checked the online payment portal and, sure enough, there was no longer an escrow form field. I was astonished that such a consequential change had been made with no notice to me, and that somehow that change in "" the system '' had resulted in two checks being auto-cancelled. It seemed the me this surely affected hundreds if not thousands of people who all individually were forced to play detective and figure out what was happening. It was also highly suspicious that I had been able to pay escrow online in XXXX, which would have been*after* this supposed policy change. Had the change been legitimate and timely communicated throughout M & T I would have received notice in XXXX, and the online portal would have simultaneously reflected the new policy. 

In order to reinstate my insurance I had to pre-pay my premium with a credit card as the insurer waited for the check ( which none of us believed at that point would ever arrive ). My insurer also had to issue me a revised, non-escrow policy. 

When I received a letter from M & T Bank it was simply several terse lines of internal bank jargon. There was no apology or explanation or even any sentence in recognizable English. Had I not just spent hours of my life troubleshooting M & T 's mistake I would have *never* understood that this letter referred to escrow, a change in policy, a change in payment portal, anything. It literally says "" We are removing the HO6 policy from your escrow account and you are responsible for the payment of the HO6 policy. '' No recipient of this letter knows what an "" HO6 '' policy is, and the sentence seems to contradict itself. The letter also managed to appear to *blame ME* for the type of mortgage M & T had *issued to me*, stating sternly "" we do not require that you maintain an HO6 policy. '' The letter did not mention that M & T failed to pay my insurance that I had prepaid in good faith. The letter did not mention the refund check, so had I not specifically asked about my additional escrow payments during the XX/XX/XXXX call ( and I was the one who brought it up and persisted until I got an answer ), I would have been flummoxed by receiving a random check in the mail. 

This was all 2 months ago. I was angry but it was fading. Then this week I received a letter from M & T Bank stating that the previous letter was in error and in fact I should have an escrow mortgage, that I am required to have an escrow mortgage. AS I ALREADY KNEW AND HAD ATTEMPTED TO TELL EVERY CUSTOMER SERVICE REP I HAD SPOKEN TO. There was this time a slight apology, as in "" sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused. '' Inconvenience??? MY INSURANCE WAS CANCELLED & I PRACTICALLY HAD A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN. 

As the final indignity, as in someone spitting on you, M & T wants ME to send back the refund check so they can put it back into the escrow account I had paid into in good faith and they themselves unilaterally cancelled with no notice. I also will have to tell my insurer they have to revise my policy yet again, back to an escrow mortgage. 

All of the burden : emotional cognitive, logistical, financial, and potentially hazard, was placed on me ( and all those in my position ) by M & T FOR ITS OWN EGREGIOUS, INEXPLICABLE MISTAKE",Mortgage,Trouble during payment process,3

4989437,"I have tried for several months now to become the successor in interest for a mortgage in my deceased husbands name. In XXXX, XXXX, my husband and I purchased our home together with both of our names on the property deed. The property address is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Virginia. However, my name was not listed as a co borrower for the mortgage -- just my husbands name. 

After the unexpected death of my husband in XX/XX/XXXX I have been trying to become a successor in interest to take over the existing mortgage to keep living in the same house raising my minor kids in stable and familiar environment. The mortgage company is failing to treat me as the borrower on this mortgage, despite its obligation under federal law to do so. 

The mortgage company provided me a list of documents required, and I have submitted those, often multiple times. Rather than telling me what document is missing, the company sends me notices, such as Please contact us at XXXX regarding the document that was received, so we can provide you clarification on what is needed. 

In fact, when I call them, they give me inconsistent explanations for deficiencies, and then proceed to try to strong-arm me into refinancing the mortgage rather than exerting my rights to become a successor in interest. This is coercive, and deprives me of my rights under federal law. 

At the request of my mortgage company, which is Select Portfolio Services, I have been submitting multiple documents they requested. For many months I have collected everything they needed with email confirmation and representatives assuring me that no additional paperwork is needed and it is being sent to be reviewed. It has become a routine practice to receive a phone call a week later after I submit additional documents from SPS XXXX to notify me that paperwork they have is insufficient. And it has been going on since XXXX. 

Every time when I talk to another representative, I ask them to list all the documents they need from me to complete the process. Their answer is always varies with different representatives. 
I have sent multiple times my bank statements, pay stubs, electric bills, proof of occupancy, hardship letter, heirs form, warranty deed, property deed, XXXX, DL. 

Last call I made I believe was XX/XX/XXXX, I was told that they could not locate some of the documents I had sent. And this has happened repeatedly over the past several months. As proof, when I send something to SPS, I always receive an acknowledgment of received emails from SPS. When SPS told me that I didn't sent something, I have an email telling otherwise, proving that I did. I'd give them date to find the email from me. 

These are the dates I sent the paperwork to SPS : XX/XX/XXXX includes our marriage certificate, deed of trust, death certificate for my husband. 
XX/XX/XXXX hardship letter, my drivers license, bank statements, HOA, proof of occupancy, my XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX assumption request form, successor in interest credit check authorization. 
XX/XX/XXXX I sent them another bank statement, I was told they couldn't find it, List of Heirs XX/XX/XXXX I sent them again proof of occupancy electric bill which they again said they don't have it or couldn't find. 
XX/XX/XXXX warranty deed and circuit court cover sheet with both mine and my husbands names on it. 
XX/XX/XXXX I sent again List of heirs and XXXX bank statements, it was missing again XX/XX/XXXX I sent via fax again list of heirs, because they claimed it was lost or not received. 

At the request of SPS, I went to probate court and got a list of heirs and the warranty deed for the property where both of our names are listed. The clerk at Probate Court told me since both our names are on the deed there are no additional documents available to send to SPS. 

On XX/XX/XXXX a representative from SPS called me with yet another issue. The representative stated that apparently the warranty deed was dated one day before the originated date of the mortgage. The warranty deed was dated XX/XX/XXXX and mortgage was originated XX/XX/XXXX. Again, I went to probate court and explained the situation. I was told that the date in this case makes no difference and they can't change anything, because there were no mistakes made, unlike what SPS tried to convince me. After so many wild goose chases, it is hard not to conclude that SPS has no intention of letting me complete the successor in interest process. 

Also per the probate clerk, according to the warranty deed XXXX grantors do hereby grant, bargain, sell and convey with General Warranty into Grantees, as tenants by the entirety with common law right of SURVIVORSHIP, all the following-described lot or parcel of land together with improvements thereon, situate, lying and being in XXXX XXXX of XXXX, XXXX XXXX Virginia XXXX '' As of today, almost 7 month later I don't know what else to do. SPS requesting papers even the Probate Court tells me do not exist. 

Now I feel like I'm being played around. As I mentioned above, during most of my phone conversations with SPS representatives, they have pushed me towards refinancing the mortgage rather than allowing me to become the successor in interest. 

I have the right under federal statutes and CFPB rules to become a successor in interest in the mortgage on my house. SPS is depriving me of my right to assume the mortgage.

Our mortgage is a XXXX owned loan and according to XXXX and Ocwen, it did not allow them to reduce our principal balance or that is what they are explaining to us. Ocwen does have a program to allow for interest reduction which would allow us to gain ground faster to reach our home 's actual value in a shorter period of time.

The major issue with this is that I have had an ongoing issue with them since XXXX XXXX, when my annual property taxes went up. I was proactive to call the company as my mortgage was transferring over from XXXX to NewRez/Shellpoint and wanted to make sure they had all the proper documentation for the change in the taxes so that my accounts were set up correctly and assessed as such. I made several calls to NewRez/Shellpoint providing them with the new tax figures that were provided to me directly from my tax accessors ' office. I was told things were noted and that they had to get verification from my tax accessor and things would then be updated. So when I received my first escrow analysis in XXXX of XXXX, I was advised these numbers were updated to reflect the new winter and summer taxes. However, as time went on this appeared not to be the case. Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX, another escrow analysis was done and I was notified that my escrow account is short $ XXXX, as well as, the change in annual taxes created the hike in payment. I call into NewRez/Shellpoint and they tell me that my escrow was short in XX/XX/XXXX when they paid my Winter taxes ( taxes that were not due until XX/XX/XXXX ) and that they didn't have the correct amount for Winter XXXX taxes ( keep in mind this was all taken care back when in XXXX XXXX when I knew my annual taxes were changing ). I made several calls then explaining they needed to go back because all that information was provided to them, and I was told the escrow done in late XXXX reflected those new winter and summer tax values. As far as the short escrow, that is not my fault -- they somehow paid it two months early from the due date. In which I was told "" well this probably happened because we had a different company who was dealing with the tax information and something happen '' -- so I'm just a victim of this, NO! They also told me that they received a document in XX/XX/XXXX that had the correct summer tax figure, but not winter XXXX tax, but the customer service representative ( XXXX XXXX ) could not show me or produce this piece of "" paper '' that claimed this. She then advised me that the best thing she could do was to escalate the issue to have the tax office get the correct information from my tax accessor and then redo another escrow analysis, this was XX/XX/XXXX. By XX/XX/XXXX, I find out after going through several loops of their misdirected communication channels ( because nobody knows anything nor can direct you to anyone, so you have to explain your situation OVER AND OVER ) that XXXX XXXX did not escalate the issue, so after getting transferred through to several departments I end up with XXXX ( XXXX.

Last year, I was also denied to participate in KYC 's PRP due to Guild 's refusal to approve in what I was told a request for re-cast. Guild informed me that a re-cast only applies to the Mortgage Re-instatement Program assistance and does not reduce principal or bring payments to a level that is affordable. However, a re-cast is not a Mortgage reinstatement but rather a process to recast your mortgage in order to lower monthly payments by making a lump sum payment to reduce the outstanding balance. With a recast the monthly mortgage payments are then recalculated based on the new, lower outstanding balance, hence lowering monthly payments. According to KYC the Mortgage Re-instatement program is separate program aside from the PRP and the two are not in conjunction with one another.

The KYC processer, XXXX XXXX, stated that the servicer, Guild Mortgage, only participates and approves principal curtailments. However, this is inaccurate. Last year, Guild 's loan counseling department informed me that an approval of KYC funds would be granted if KYC applied the PRP assistance to reduce my property 's principal by way of loan modification. I was also informed that Guild approves KYC funds to reduce or eliminate the non-interest-bearing forbearance amount that resulted from my prior loss mitigation agreement. 

Ironically, Guild stated to me that a request for a re-cast only re-instates the mortgage to a positive balance foregoing any reduction in monthly payments. Again, this is an inaccurate statement. Why is Guild denying KYC 's request for approval of the PRP mortgage assistance a 2nd time around? 

Guild 's refusal to participate in a "" re-cast '' modification, combined with inaccurate statements regarding the program descriptions coupled with the servicer 's lack of official explanation for the denial is a violation of my homeowner 's rights. 

While waiting for a response from your department and/or Guild Mortgage Company, please accept this letter as my official request to apply and be considered for one of Guild 's loss mitigation loan workouts.

Dear CFPB, Thank you for your response and for forwarding XXXX 's reply regarding my complaint. 

Unfortunately, XXXX 's response is inaccurate. While they are correct that our son 's car was totaled on XX/XX/XXXX, their claim regarding GAP insurance is misleading. GAP insurance was never offered to us at the time of purchase, nor did we decline it. By the time we reviewed and signed the documents, the GAP insurance option had already been marked as declined, leaving us with no opportunity to opt in. However, that is not the primary issue at hand. 

The main concern is that we never received a payoff statement via email. Instead, after months of waiting, we finally received a letter from XXXX stating that we still have the XXXX  though the vehicle was totaled, and our insurance company issued a payment for the loss. Since XX/XX/XXXX, we have been waiting for a formal payoff statement or any correspondence from XXXX to finalize the remaining balance due. The only correspondence we have received is that we are late on payments, that they are reporting us to our credit and as of XX/XX/XXXX have reported this as a charge off. 


Despite our repeated attempts to resolve this matter, we received no communication until XX/XX/XXXX, when XXXX finally sent us a small printout of our payment historyrather than the necessary payoff statement or final settlement details and they are claiming we still have the car and will reposess it. 

We request your assistance in ensuring that XXXX provides a proper payoff statement and any remaining documentation needed to close this matter. 

Because we are getting no assistance with this matter we have retained a lawyer at our own expense.

2414322,"Hello, Let me say- I have written XXXX XXXX XXXX President Obama , XXXX XXXX , XXXX XXXX early on, Nobody believed me! 
My name is XXXX, I am a mother who had her home stolen and foreclosed on back in XX/XX/XXXX. It began in XX/XX/XXXX and I am writing to tell you some of what happened to me. My last hope was the '' foreclosure review '' That was cancelled. I was devastated again! 
I was never notified of any part of my home being foreclosed on. No calls, none of the stories you hear of people in their homes for years. IT WAS JUST GONE! 
What took place in the United States with these unlawful foreclosures ; not only for my family, but from what I am finding out so many families is an atrocity. For these mortgage companies to be allowed to brush it under the rugs like they are is shameful. I wonder if this happened to their mother or children, would their outlook be the same ... I 'm betting no. 
I am a home owner that did lose my home during this time. No, I 'm sorry I did not lose my home ... It was stolen from our family. 
I was five days late with my payment, after being in our home for 14 years and received a letter from Wells Fargo lawyers that we were in a foreclosure. To call and make the entire balance of our mortgage and then even maybe they could see what they could do. I called Wells Fargo, and was told not to worry, to apply for a modification- I would be all set ... 
My next month 's payment was made, and when my statement came it said "" unapplied '', however had been cashed. Long story short, we came home to locks on our home with everything in it. Even our dog. Our home was sold at auction, and we were not informed of any of it. Over a payment that was less than a week late!!! Not a person in the world believed me!! This review was supposed to reverse our credit- maybe be able to buy a home again!!!! Now were still right here with absolutely NOTHING. And then send tax document owing everything that was remaining?!?!?! 
And who is to say between all of us who was wrongfully foreclosed on and who just sat on their ... & did n't pay their mortgages? I am lumped in with deadbeats and people that are just no good. Does that correct the years my XXXX girls have spent hating me because they believe that I must have done something to be where we are because after all I taught them that when you work hard and do what 's right and are honest ... You will get what you deserve. They certainly do not deserve what we were given that day, and every day since. 
Regarding evidence of what happened to my family, it is difficult because we are not in our home. I have a few pieces of paperwork, but only a few. I 'm sure my bank would have copies of cancelled checks, and I have a statement from Wells Fargo that has listed under the payments section on two consecutive months preceding the foreclosure "" unapplied ''. ( so where was my payment going? ) Wells Fargo wrote me and said "" they drove by and there was no car in the driveway '' they believed the home was empty and secured their investment '' WHAT!!!!!!! They said they mailed letters- sent me dates AFTER THEY SOLD IT! SWORE THEY SPOKE TO MY HUSBAND- to a XXXX # that was a Wells Fargo #!!! All Lies! The foreclosure was taken off of my credit report- "" BECAUSE I NEVER MISSED A PAYMENT "" ummm how do you foreclose never having missed a payment???? I was forced to file bankruptcy becaue I was sent a tax document demanding the balance owed in the home stolen! 
I was not allowed back in to get anything I Owned, I lost EVERYTHING! 7 years of misery for their Selfish Lies. They have Paid others IN FULL. I DESERVE FULL PAYMENT! I DESERVE AN APOLOGY! My CHILDREN DESERVE TO KNOW I AM HONEST!!! They need to pay me! And correct my credit.

This notice states that your claim is disputed and validation of the account is required.

This notice is not a request for verification of the account or proof of my mailing address but a request for validation made pursuant to the F.D.C.P.A. laws. I humbly request that your agency/ office sends me valid proof of claim that I am legally obligated to pay you.

Please provide me with the below mentioned items : * The amount you claim the Respondent owes you * An explanation showing me how you have computed the amount.

* Copies of any documents that prove I agreed to pay the alleged amount * The identity of the original creditor * Confirmation that the account has not crossed the statute of limitation ( SOL ) period * Evidence that you are a licensed debt collector * Evidence of your license numbers and your registered agent.

I would like to inform you that in case your agency has reported invalidated account information to any of the three main credit bureaus such as XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, then it will be regarded as a fraudulent action under both federal and state statutes. Due to this reason, if any negative item is reported to any of my credit reports by your agency or the agency that you represent, then I will be compelled to take legal steps against you for the below mentioned reasons : * Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( F.C.R.A. ) * Violation of the F.D.C.P.A. 
* Defamation of character * Use of my copyrighted property I would like to further inform you that if any action is taken during the validation period which could be regarded as detrimental to any of my credit reports, then I will seek advice about initiating a potential lawsuit. This includes listing any information on a credit report that could be incorrect or invalidated, or confirming an account as correct when, in fact, there is no provided evidence that it is. 

If your agency can provide me with the requested documents, I will need a minimum of thirty ( 30 ) days to investigate this information, and during this period of time, all collection activities must be stopped.

Also, I request that you provide evidence that I must pay you in anything other than appropriate commercial paper should the debt be proven valid because, to my knowledge, the U.S. Congress provided the appropriate remedy for me to settle my debts via the remedy in House Joint Resolution ( H.J.R. ) 192 of XX/XX/1933 under the United States, Public Law 73-10, and Public Law 48 stat. 112 ( among others ).

If your agency/ company fails to respond to this debt validation request within a period of ten ( 10 ) days from the date of your receipt of my notice and affidavit, then the account information must be completely deleted from my credit report, and a copy of such deletion request should be sent to me at once, or I will take legal action.

I would also like to request, in writing, that no calls should be made by your agency or company at my residence or workplace. If your agency attempts to make unlimited or computer generated calls to me or any third parties, then it will be considered harassment, and I will have no option but to file a lawsuit. All future communications with me should be done in writing and sent to the address mentioned in this letter. Further, any correspondence must be made in the form of a commercial affidavit under penalty of perjury and sent by certified mail. Any other form of service shall be deemed defective upon its face.

16272654,"I submit this formal complaint against Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian for their continued and willful violations of federal consumer protection laws under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). These violations include the unlawful reinsertion of previously deleted accounts without proper notification, failure to ensure maximum possible accuracy, failure to investigate disputes within the mandated time frame, failure to provide verification details upon request, and failure to validate debt prior to reporting. 

Background & Violations My credit reports contain fraudulent accounts and unauthorized inquiries that the Bureaus have failed to properly investigate and address despite multiple disputes and supporting documentation. Additionally, these Bureaus have removed fraudulent accounts and unauthorized inquiries only to reinsert them without proper validation, constituting an egregious violation of 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( a ) and ( b ). 
Furthermore, I sent a certified dispute letter to all three credit bureaus requesting verification details, including contracts, signatures, and all relevant documentation for these accounts. Despite more than 15 days passing, I have not received any response or documentation from any of the bureaus, which constitutes an additional violation of federal consumer protection laws, specifically : 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) : Failure to investigate disputes within the required 30-day period.

15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) : Failure to provide notice and certification before reinserting previously deleted information.

15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) : Failure to ensure maximum possible accuracy.

15 U.S.C. 1692g ( a ) ( 4 ) : Failure to provide verification of debt, including original contracts and signatures, upon request.

15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ) ( B ) ( iii ) : Failure to provide specific details on dispute findings. 

Related Lawsuits & CFPB Actions The CFPB has actively taken enforcement actions against the credit bureaus for similar violations, further demonstrating a pattern of noncompliance. These legal precedents reinforce the validity of my complaint : Experian Lawsuit ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : The CFPB filed a lawsuit against Experian for failing to properly investigate consumer disputes regarding credit report inaccuracies. The lawsuit alleged that Experian allowed erroneous information to reappear on reports, impacting consumers ' credit, employment, and housing access. The CFPB seeks to halt Experian 's misconduct, provide redress, and impose penalties. 
TransUnion Settlement ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : The CFPB, alongside the FTC, reached a {$15.00} XXXX settlement with TransUnion and its subsidiary, TransUnion Rental Screening Solutions , Inc., for failing to ensure the accuracy of tenant screening reports. The agency charged that TransUnions inaccuracy potentially hindered consumers ' ability to secure housing. TransUnion agreed to pay {$11.00} XXXX in restitution and a {$4.00} XXXX civil penalty and implement enhanced accuracy measures. 
Equifax Lawsuit ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : The CFPB filed a major lawsuit against Equifax for repeated violations of the FCRA and deceptive practices that misled consumers regarding credit report accuracy. The lawsuit highlighted that Equifax knowingly reported incorrect information, failed to correct disputes in a timely manner, and continued to allow erroneous reinsertion of previously deleted data without proper consumer notification. The CFPB is seeking financial penalties, injunctive relief, and systemic reforms to prevent future violations. 
These actions underscore the CFPBs commitment to enforcing the FCRA and ensuring that consumer reporting agencies uphold their obligations. My case mirrors these past violations, and I urge the CFPB to take similar action against Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian.

Demands for Resolution Immediate Removal and Blockage : Remove and block all fraudulent accounts and unauthorized inquiries from my credit file across all three bureaus. 
Ensure that these accounts and inquiries are not reinserted without proper validation as required under 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ).

Written Confirmation : Provide written confirmation of the removal of these accounts and inquiries along with updated copies of my credit reports.

Thorough Investigation : Conduct a full investigation into how these fraudulent accounts and inquiries were recorded without my consent. 
Provide findings in writing, including all requested verification details, such as contracts and signatures. 
Compliance with Identity Theft Protections : Implement fraud alerts and provide me with identity theft resources as mandated under 15 U.S.C. 1681g ( e ). 
The continued noncompliance by Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian has caused significant financial harm and distress. The reinsertion of fraudulent accounts and inquiries without proper validation exacerbates these violations. Given the CFPBs history of legal action against these credit bureaus for similar misconduct, I urge immediate enforcement action to ensure compliance with federal law and provide appropriate remedies under 15 U.S.C. 1681n and 1681o for willful and negligent violations.

5189378,"My VA loan with Pennymac has been in COVID related forbearance. When I reached the end of my forbearance duration, we started the loan modification process. This has been an absolute nightmare. 

Pennymac began calling me repeatedly every 2-3 days during work and during dinner. They would call with a robot and say I needed to call X number immediately and it concerned my loan. Given that this is extremely important to me, I always drop what I am doing and call. When I call they tell me they are busy and put me on hold for up to 45 minutes. When I finally get someone I ask them "" why did you call if you weren't ready to speak? '' They respond they are allowed to and threaten me if I wish for them to stop calling they will, but I will be financially responsible for any information they are unable to provide me. I am not saying they can't call, but I think it is incredibly messed up they call me, then immediately place me on hold. This is clearly an illegal pressure technique to make my life as miserable as possible so I acquiesce to their demands. Attempts to address this with their management result in them telling me "" to write Pennymac a letter ''. 

Pennymac claims they have provided me a Single Point of Contact ( SPOC ), but I have yet to speak to the same person aside from the initial call. When I ask to speak with my SPOC they rudely tell me my SPOC is busy and it would take them weeks to call back and they "" are part of my SPOC team ''. This is particularly frustrating is because every new person that calls is woefully unfamiliar with my case and I have to reexplain the entire background every time they call. Every single time they fail to review the notes on my file, tell me "" its not their job to review my file before they call ''. Every single time they call and ask for information, it is information I have already provided. 


Pennymac has been calling me every 2-3 days and harassing me about the loan modification process. This is obviously an illegal pressure tactic. They have three times mailed the loan modification paperwork to the wrong address. They rudely tell me the paperwork has been delivered to my house and aggressively ask why I haven't signed it? I ask what address they sent it to, and they tell me ( wrong address ), and I respond it is the wrong address. I give them the right address, but apparently they don't write it down or if they do, the following "" SPOC '' fails to review that note and again proceeds to mail it again to the wrong address. This process has repeated itself half a dozen times. Finally, after asking to speak to a manager to stop this madness they arrange a mobile notary, I promptly meet up with notary and sign the paperwork. I have since received 5 calls asking why I haven't signed my paperwork and wondering about if it had arrived in the mail. This is extremely infuriating because when I ask them to review my notes, they respond "" oh yeah I see that a mobile notary has mailed in the paperwork ''. I then ask why they called if they already had the answer to the question? They respond its their right to call and if I don't want them to call I will be financially responsible for any information i miss. 

Pennymac has clearly adopted aggressive and illegal pressure tactics during this process. They have failed to provide a SPOC. They call incessantly requesting information they have already been provided. They have been beyond arrogant and adopted a threatening tone and posture. They have demonstrated they are clearly unapologetically unorganized. They have shown a blatant disregard towards me and disrespected my time.

3293566,"On XX/XX/XXXX my home, in XXXX, LA, was totally destroyed by a tornado. 

Subsequently my insurer, XXXX XXXX, issued me a check ( copy attached ) for payment of my policy in full {$330.00}, XXXX I received the check on XX/XX/XXXX and called the mortgage service company, Lakeview Loan Servicing , LLC ( LAKEVIEW ) of  XXXX, SC. 

LAKEVIEW directed me to the website of XXXX ( XXXX  ) where I created an account and read through the instructions. I was immediately struck by how vague everything seemed and was disinclined to endorse my $ XXXX check without at least asking someone else how this is supposed to go. Not one person I spoke to - my neighbors, attorneys, bankers, mortgage people - had any experience other than the mortgage company endorsed the check and gave it back to THEM. Finally on XX/XX/XXXX I signed the check and send it overnight. 

But I was stymied. There was literally no one to talk to that could tell me anything beyond the script in front of them. My first call to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX was to request some forms ( attached ) which they required. I spoke to XXXX, she was very nice and explained that website wasn't working right and for me to wait a day or two and try again. When I asked her to email me the forms she said, "" We don't do email. It's too risky. '' She offered to email the forms. It took over two weeks for me to receive them. Meanwhile in a few days I was able to download the forms a filed to receive a payment to pay my Architectural fees. So far nothing. 

My bigger issue, than trying to get {$20000.00} for the architectural fees, was the {$100000.00} or so that represented my equity - funds they were holding beyond my mortgage balance. I got nowhere. I did have one phone rep ( not XXXX ) tell me "" It is illegal for us to keep that money ... '' as if the fact that it was illegal automatically meant they wouldn't do it. I laughed out loud at her. 

I spare you the rest up until today. Today, I took a different approach. I called my original mortgage broker and told him I need the name of their general counsel so my attorney could name them in my suit. In a few minutes I received a phone call from XXXX XXXX, CFO of XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NMLS LOC ID # XXXX T : XXXX XXXX | XXXX XXXX XXXX F : XXXX XXXX XXXX E : XXXX W : XXXX Mr. XXXX was very attentive and sensitive to my situation. His suggestion was that I file a complain with CFPB. He also provided me with the information of the LAKEVIEW CEO : XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX Tel:XXXX So here we are. 

In terms of timeline Mr. XXXX called me while I was having lunch with my wife around XXXX XXXX. He followed up with an email at XXXX XXXX and promised "" Well try to reach out through our channels. '' Shortly after his email I was on the phone with CFPB 's rep XXXX XXXX. She walked me through your process. While I was on the phone with her, I looked at the XXXX website again and discovered an entry - not there before lunch - that my claim had been escalated for "" REVIEW '' on XX/XX/XXXX, last Friday. Less than 30 minutes later I checked again and happily discovered that my check had been "" APPROVED. '' By XXXX they had posted a XXXX   tracking number. Mr. XXXX said he had not influenced LAKEVIEWs actions. I think that is unlikely. 

So what next? I am still XXXX. According their website they will issue {$40000.00} immediately, 50 % at some interim point and the rest upon final completion and acceptance. Zero detail on what "" interim '' is or what "" final completion is. '' At this point I've only been promised the funds that are lawfully mine ( and unlawfully held for a month ) although I can presume I'll have them tomorrow. As they are unlikely to send certified funds I'll likely have to wait for collected funds before I can use them. 

It's clear to me in order to rebuild my house I will have to pursue construction financing on my own. This is unacceptable as I continue to make mortgage payments while they are holding my money at zero interest.",Mortgage,Trouble during payment process,1

I also received an email and several morecalls like this from XXXX XXXX XXXX branch. I did not think that much about this at the time, because I could not findthis on XXXX website. 
However today I thought about it, and it almostseemed like there were some strange or illegal things happening at XXXX XXXX  XXXX office. I listed some cases involvingXXXX  below. 
1. Today ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I used the check to transfer {$900000.00} ( XXXX XXXX XXXX dollars ) from XXXX to my BOA account. When I deposited the check at BOA counter, I was told that this deposit should be available on XX/XX/XXXX! I was shocked by this! It will take 8 business days. Before I went to the BOA office to do the deposit, I tried to transfer using XXXX online banking, but it only allowed {$100000.00} ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) per day, and it will be posted after two business days. So I have to go to BOA to do a large deposit. I asked the BOA cashier why it would take so long, she told me that BOA needed to contact XXXX to release the found to them first, and XXXX needed a long time to do that. Then she processed my deposit, but she did not tell me anything about my deposit again. After I went back home, I checked my deposit receipt. One is Client Receipt which reads deposit XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, IntRef XXXX, for the hold, see hold notice. The other is a hold notice, on this hold notice, without the hold code, reads {$5300.00} avail XX/XX/XXXX XXXX, {$890000.00} avail XX/XX/XXXX XXXX, but where is the other {$220.00}? On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX, I just checked my Chase checking account, the amount XXXX was be held by XXXX , but if it is as BOA told me, this amount should be posted at BOA account on XX/XX/XXXX, where is this money from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX? I do not know what happened, but I think all of the deposit is really weird, unbelievable and unreasonable. 
2. I also encountered a lot of unreasonable things with my XXXX account. For example, I paid XXXX credit card bill {$970.00} using my XXXX  checking account on XX/XX/XXXX, Now XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, this amount was still was shown as pending on the checking account, and has not appear on my XXXX credit card statement, but my XXXX credit cards available credit was increase by XXXX. I list some records of my paying my XXXX credit card from my XXXX checking amount during the current billing cycle ( XX/XX/XXXX to now ), for your reference. 
Paid amount. Credit card post date Checking account list date {$4700.00} XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX {$730.00} XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX {$730.00} XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX {$570.00} XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX {$570.00} XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX {$730.00} XXXX still pendingNow ( XXXX ) 3. I also encountered another problem with my XXXX credit card. Within the current billing cycle, I had some charges from different merchants, but all of them charged my XXXX credit card ( not pending, charged ) before they sent out items or before I picked up the items. One of themerchants even charged me a higher amount than what I authorized in store ( I kept the receipt ). I do not know what happened to my credit card, but I do not think that all of these were done by merchants. 
4. The deposit of amount {$900000.00} is that I transferred from XXXX to BOA was available on XX/XX/XXXX. At the same day, I transfer it to my XXXX investment account, for the recorder, I used the print button of the transfer online page. But I got a weird confirmation page. I attached it for your referrrence. This transfer is still pending at my XXXX investment account from XX/XX/XXXX to now ( XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ). I also do not understand why the transfer between BOA accounts need so long time. Why I met so many unnormal things because I need transfer my money. 

For above, I wish you pay more attention on it.

The FCRA requires consumer reporting agencies to block such information within 4 business days of receiving : Proof of identity ; A copy of a valid identity theft report The identification of the fraudulent information in question ; and A statement that the information is not related to any transaction I made.

Furthermore, the credit reporting agencies have a legal obligation to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the data they report under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ). The continued reporting of inaccurate, unverifiable, or fraudulent information is a violation of federal law.

THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM : On XX/XX/year>, I initiated ONE {$500.00} transfer from XXXX  XXXX ( XXXX ) to SoFi using the SoFi app. 
I have documentation from XXXX  XXXX showing that SoFi 's system sent TWO separate ACH debit requests for {$500.00} each, totaling {$1000.00}. I only initiated one {$500.00} transfer in the SoFi app. 

This was a system error on SoFi 's end. 
XXXX  XXXX processed both ACH requests and sent {$1000.00} total. 
However, only {$500.00} arrived in my SoFi account.

This raises a critical question : If SoFi 's system requested {$1000.00} from XXXX  XXXX, and XXXX  XXXX sent {$1000.00}, where is the other {$500.00}? 

Either : SoFi received {$1000.00} but only credited my account {$500.00}, OR SoFi only received {$500.00} despite requesting {$1000.00} Either way, this is SoFi 's problem to investigate and resolve. 

THE REVERSALS THAT MADE IT WORSE : Since reporting this issue, {$1000.00} has been reversed OUT of my SoFi account in two separate {$500.00} reversals. 

This is wrong because : Only {$500.00} was ever legitimately transferred to SoFi The second {$500.00} reversal took money that was already in my SoFi account BEFORE I initiated this transfer. This money had nothing to do with the problematic transfer.

There have been no late payments on the loan over the term. the complaint is due to an insurance error by the bank in mortgage escrow. My homeowners insurance that is escrowed increased significantly so I found a new more competitive insurance policy. 
US Bank made the payment to the old insurer in XX/XX/XXXX. I informed US bank of the change and the payment was returned to me by the insurance company. I made a payment back to escrow to reimburse since a new insurance payment was going to be made. 
US Bank admits the returned escrow payment was made but for an unknown reason, the payment was never recorded. This caused a shortfall in the escrow amount. I disputed the recalculated escrow amount due to US bank errors from XX/XX/XXXX to current. 
My mortgage payment is an auto pay from another bank and payments have been made each month but not to the erroneous amount that US Bank claims. As a result, US Bank has continued to not apply my payment and each month holds it in "" suspense '' and charged late fees and I believe has reported as late to credit reporting bureau..

What requirements must be met to initiate cancellation of PMI? 
The loan must be current on mortgage payments. 
The loan must have a good payment history. A good payment history means : o No payments 30 days past due in the last 12 months, and o No payments 60 days past due in the last 24 months. 
The current property value must be at least equal to its original value The loan must meet the applicable loan to value ratio ( LTV ) provided in the PMI Cancellation Matrix on Page 2.

There must not be any subordinate lien ( s ) attached to the property. 
For properties located in Minnesota, the property must be owner occupied. 
For loans seasoned less than 2 years where substantial improvements are claimed, evidence of substantial improvements are required. This includes a list of improvements, contracts, and receipts ( see the FAQs on page 3 for more information ).

Loancare is charging us {$310.00} per month to fund our escrow account which only needs about {$120.00} per month.

Why they feel the need to overcharge our escrow account when our property taxes and insurance costs are in black and white is beyond me. Don't they have competent accountants?

4466163,"XX/XX/XXXX EXPERIAN XXXX Experian XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX This complaint is filed against Experian for the harm caused to my credit as a result of the lack process in investigating the disputes filed against XXXX XXXX at least 7 times in the last year. I was most appalled yesterday XX/XX/XXXX after I received the XXXX results of the 2 disputes that EXPERIAN issued for 2 XXXX XXXX cards starting with XXXX and XXXX submitted on XX/XX/XXXX where Experian concluded on XX/XX/XXXX that the information in my dispute were verified as accurate despite, I submitted evidence of the credit card statements being issued as business credit cards under a business name, XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX as the account holder and I was just the signor. 

XXXX XXXX sent me a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX that I have attached where it is stated that XXXX XXXX can not provide me the proof that I requested them to provide to support their claim that I bare personal responsibility for the business credit cards. They can not provide such proof according to them because they only keep records for 5 years. XXXX XXXX has no records to prove their claim, yet they keep abusing me and keep violating the Fair Debt Collection Practice Act by reporting false information they can not support with either a personal credit card application or business credit card application and credit card agreement that shows that I applied for the cards under my name or I agreed to pay for the business credit cards. Without any documents to support their claim, EXPERIAN can not continue to keep contacting XXXX XXXX who continues to provide false information each time. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the same day the XX/XX/XXXX dispute was completed by EXPERIAN, my credit score dropped from XXXX to XXXX and went up to XXXX after I complained. The score further went up to XXXX, then on XX/XX/XXXX, the same day the last dispute submitted on XX/XX/XXXX was completed, my score dropped 47 points from XXXX to XXXX. Nothing changed in my credit file, not a thing. There a pattern of being victimized by EXPERIAN for no reasons when nothing in credit file changed and they do so each time a dispute about XXXX XXXX is completed. 

Experian decided to intentionally ignore the proof provided on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX that I submitted and insisted the business credit cards are individual responsibility by simply contacting XXXX XXXX and did request nor obtain any proof XXXX XXXX such as a signed consumer credit card application and signed consumer credit card agreement to support their confirmation statements. So, Experian concluded despite evidence I submitted showing the XXXX  Statements showing thee 2 cards in question are business credit cards and not consumer credit cards, yet XXXX XXXX words of deceit by passing business credit cards as consumer credit cards were taken over the evidence submitted while the evidence is XXXX XXXX own statements which I am resubmitting. In their own letter attached, they admitted that the credit cards were business credit cards and not personal credit cards. This abuse must stop. My score should be restored to XXXX and EXPERIAN must stop manipulating my credit file every time, they contact XXXX XXXX who continues to falsely confirm that these credit cards are personal credit cards. 
EXPERIANs conduct is harming my ability to get credit currently. I had mortgage applications that were declined on XX/XX/XXXX and were reconsidered by the lender after I informed them that my score went up to XXXX. Now my score being maliciously dropped by 47 points when there is no new derogatory information added and my pending mortgage will be aborted for sure once the lender performs another credit check before I close the mortgage later this month. 

The 2 XXXX XXXX business cards must be deleted since XXXX XXXX confirmed to me on XX/XX/XXXX that they can not produce any proof to support their claim that these credit cards are my responsibility. Experian should look into their own records to observe that these two cards were never reported under my credit file in XXXX and XXXX when these two cards were opened, instead XXXX XXXX decided to charge off these two cards under my personal credit file in XXXX when the business closed and stopped paying XXXX XXXX for payments owed on the 2 cards. 


This should be obvious to EXPERIAN that if these cards were opened in XXXX and XXXX, why were they never reported to any credit reporting agency as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act under my credit file with Experian or any other credit reporting agency. Experian must exercise good judgment to decide who is honest and dishonest in this dispute. If the credit cards were mine, why XXXX XXXX never reported them as consumer credit under as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act in XXXX and XXXX when they were opened. They were not reported because they were not mine and when the business failed to pay XXXX XXXX after it closed in XXXX, in XXXX, XXXX XXXX wrongfully decided to charge off the corporate cards under my credit file. Attached is my XX/XX/XXXX Experian credit report that I am submitting as proof that shows the 2 XXXX XXXX credit cards were never part of my credit file prior to XXXX and these cards were viciously added in XXXX. My credit was stellar at XXXX prior to XXXX and since XXXX, I have been badly damaged and abused by XXXX XXXX for 4 years with a false claim which they continue to confirm every time EXPERIAN contacts them for my disputes. I am paying a 19 percent interest rate on my car loan with XXXX XXXX  because of the harm caused by XXXX XXXX. 

Now, there is enough proof provided to delete these two XXXX XXXX accounts immediately, regardless of XXXX XXXX continue to mislead and lie about the facts.

They advised that proof of payment wasnt available for 8 days after the payment processed.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I set up a payment through a third party payment service and the mortgage payment was to process on XX/XX/XXXX and reach Loan Care on XX/XX/XXXX, that is LESS than one week from when the loan was finalized by Loan Care. On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, I received a voice message from Loan Care to call them. I called and they were asking for a payment. I told them it was only four days since they finalized the loan and two of those days were weekend days. The rep said the call was an auto call and I should disregard it and she would take the info off my account. Two days later, XX/XX/XXXX, I got another voice message to call Loan Care and I called them back and yes, they are calling about a payment! This is harassment! Two days a part and I had already been told it would be taken off the file, as well as being told I had 60 days to set up a payment! The rep on Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX, told me to disregard the call ; the payment had been received! Calling two days a part for a payment is harassment and it is magnified by the fact that Loan Care didnt have the loan finalized until XX/XX/XXXX AND we are in the middle of a pandemic! If this is how Loan Care does business they need to be shut down. They should not be servicing loans AND be a debt collection agency. That definitely blurs the lines for them and in my opinion creates a conflict of interest. They service a loan but do business like the debt collection agency with the mortgages they service. On a side note, I did not pick Loan Care for my mortgage. My mortgage was sold to them by XXXX XXXX. They also need to follow the law.

3866074,"I was given a forbearance on my primary mortgage with US Bank back the all of this COVID crisis started, not for my inability to pay but simply because the future was uncertain and I felt it would be smart to do so. When the forbearance ended I made the multiple payments when they were due and got caught up. I have never missed a mortgage payment, I consider paying on time, paying late. I usually pay weeks before a due date. I have impeccable credit. 

I regret not keeping better records of the dates and bills to which I am now going to address, but you expect not to have these types of issues, so my explanation will be recalled from memory. 

Months ago, maybe XXXX, I get a bill of XXXX due for my HELOC with US Bank. I thought this was odd, but considering many times I pay more than what is due, I though perhaps I actually do not owe ( when I thought that I should ). I did not spend the money, but put it aside in case later I found out that they had made a mistake. I month or 2 later and get a bill 3 or 4 times larger than I expect, ( more than it should have been even if there was an earlier mistake ) disturbed and upset, I pay it, but only because I didn't want to deal with the back and forth and headache and stresses that come along with trying to resolve an issue. 

Then about a month later, while checking out my accounts online It says, again XXXX due. I think to my self, "" Ok, I did pay more that I though was due last time, I guess they have credited my account and this could be right ''. Fast forward to XXXX ... I'm looking to pay a bill for XX/XX/XXXX. I should owe a normal payment typically somewhere around $ XXXX {$140.00}. The online profile says {$580.00} due XX/XX/XXXX, and I know this can not be correct. It should have read $ XXXX {$140.00} due XX/XX/XXXX. Even if XXXX 's bill was skipped an XXXX payment would have only been $ XXXX {$280.00}. I begin making phone calls to US Bank to try to resolve the discrepancy. Multiple phone calls. Hours upon hours of phone calls ( no exaggeration ). I eventually find out that US Bank had out my HELOC into a forbearance plan ( WHICH I NEVER ASKED FOR ), it came off of said forbearance and was placed on one again! All without my asking. Since XXXX I have been calling trying to make the payment that I KNOW should be due for XXXX to no avail. XX/XX/XXXX goes and comes- thank XXXX their systems says XXXX 's payment isn't due otherwise my credit would be affected. I continue to call multiple times and spend hours being switched back and forth between different incorrect departments, each time having to tell my story all over again, each time with no results and no real cooperation, empathy or concern from US Bank. Mind you what we have here s someone calling in and practically begging to make a payment I actually should be due ... Finally I lose my temper 2 or 3 weeks ago while speaking to XXXX XXXX ID # XXXX ( this in unfortunately where I start taking notes with each conversation ). She puts my on the phone with someone named XXXX XXXX ID # XXXX email address XXXX ... I lose my mind at this point an blow up. I cuss like a XXXX. I tell hime exactly what I think about how sorry they have treated me and how no one cares at all to help. When I say I lost my mind and blew up, I mean it. The guy got a BIG earful. Guess what? This guy actually begins to put the pieces together, says he understands what needs to be done and will make sure that he watches the process ( which would be handled through another department ) each day he came into work. He even gave me his personal email address to follow up with him if I had any questions but that he felt it should be resolved within a few days to a week and that he would call me daily with updates/progress reports. I believe this conversation with XXXX was around XXXX XXXX. I apologize for losing my temper with him ( because that is NOT who I am ... it takes ALOT to bring me to that point ), and he said he understood because he and his wife had just got done refinancing his house and what should have taken a month took over 6 months. It seemed at that point that maybe there was some hope, maybe this guy would work for me to get the issues fixed. Sure enough the next day he calls me with a little progress report that everything was with the right department now and being handled. A day or 2 goes by and I believe I get another phone call from him with a little update, no real progress yet, stay tuned ... That was the last I heard from him. Meanwhile, I'm going online looking at my statement and STILL NO CHANGES. I reach out by email to him on XX/XX/XXXX and get no response. I reach out to hime by email on XX/XX/XXXX, still no response. Here today XX/XX/XXXX, after being on the phone yet again this morning, NO PROGRESS. The lady I spoke with today was named XXXX who was in the Ohio call center. When I get on the phone with her I simply ask that she pull up my account and begin reading the notes attached to my file, Each time I have spoken to someone at US BANK before I let them get off the phone with me I ask them specifically to add notes to my file recording the details of our conversation, date, and times. XXXX XXXX told me that NO notes have been attached to my file by the XXXX people that I have spoken to since this whole fiasco began and still NO resolution. I refuse to speak any further to her and asked agin to speak to someone in authority, to which she replied no one was available. Eventually she says a manager named XXXX, also from the call center in OH would call me back ... .still waiting. 

The Labyrinth of inefficiency and continued passing off to other incorrect departments, and a complete lack of empathy from the people of US Bank runs rampant there. What frustrates me are the endless HOURS of phone calls that I have had to make and the repeated conversations over and over again to people who evidently can do nothing. As XXXX is my witness I have had multiple hours of conversations, each frustrating and stressful. I value my time above just about everything else because it's sometime that we all only have a certain amount of. No to mention the stress of having to deal with the endless failures with each call. Honestly companies like this some somehow be held accountable for their actions. It is absolutely ridiculous to think that this level of incompetence and utter disregard for their customers is not taken seriously. I hope that in some way they can experience the stress and anguish that we consumers feel and change for the better because of it .... I would much rather spend my time doing something else rather that composing this description of my interactions with US Bank for the public to see. I do hope this record of my experience will help others to avoid the trouble that I have had, and perhaps persuade others to find a company who will value the customers to do business with.",Mortgage,Trouble during payment process,3

Despite multiple requests for correction, including dispute letters sent on XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year>, the erroneous late payment information has not been corrected. This ongoing inaccuracy violates provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), and the Protection Against Non-Payment of Obligations Act ( PAANL ). 
Discrepancies : XXXX XXXX : Only TransUnion has a last verified date ( XX/XX/year> ) ; XXXX and XXXX do not list XXXX. 
Date of Last Activity : Only TransUnion lists a date ( XX/XX/year> ) ; XXXX and XXXX do not list XXXX.

Violations : Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : Under XXXX U.S.C. XXXX, credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the accuracy of the information they report. The continued presence of inaccurate late payment entries on my credit report demonstrates non-compliance with this mandate.

Evidence of Error : Payment History : Documentation from XXXX XXXX confirms no late payments were made on this account for the periods in question. 
Prior Disputes : Attached copies of my previous dispute letters dated XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year>, along with proof of submission.

JPMorgan Chase Bank National Association has again failed to obey basic banking and mortgage regulations on far too numerous occasions to mention. This letter is intended to merely enumerate several such instances that involves, a failure to supervise, Robo-Signing, deceptive issuance of credit, failure to uphold their fiduciary responsibility as a financial services provider, and an overall contempt for governance and rule of law, concerning our complaint case. 

We have received the same JPMorgan form letter with variations that never truly answer our questions but just cut and paste previous statements. No one ever signs the letter so we have no one to correspond to directly. 
JPMorgan needs to be held accountable for their many negligence 's.

2120965,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out to Wells Fargo and informed them that I was having difficulties with making my payments due to my husband ( at the time ) loss of income for the past several months. I was informed that I may qualify for the home modification. Not, knowing much about the process, I agreed to proceed. Shortly after the modification process began, I then lost my job as well. There was minimal to no income for a short period of time. Full modification packages were sent to Wells Fargo several times from XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. When an trial period plan was finally offered on XX/XX/XXXX, there was approximately {$120000.00} in overdue payment added to the balance of the mortgage. First payment was due on XXXX XXXX ( after years of reaching out to Wells Fargo for assistance ). XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out to Wells Fargo and informed them that my current situation has changed, my husband filed for divorce and moved out. My household income went from XXXX to XXXX. I asked if the trail offer can be reviewed with my income only, Wells Fargo did not respond nor was I informed that it was not an option. XX/XX/XXXX, a sale date was placed on my home. I had to file an action to show cause on XXXX XXXX and had much evidence to present to the judge showing that I 've been reaching out to Wells Fargo for years for a modification, but due to the change in my circumstance was trying to see if there was anything that can be done, if not, I will make the trail payments. The judge ordered Wells Fargo to work with me and reinstate the trail offer payments. During XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo and their attorneys refused to speak to me or my attorney. We were told that since the case is in litigation they can not speak to us. During this time, late fees is being accrued. I was sending letters after letters, full modification packages after packages, but no response until XX/XX/XXXX, when was informed that another sale date of XX/XX/XXXX was placed on my home. I reached out to Wells Fargo, pleading with them to work with me. I sent in another modification package, but they refuse to review stating that there was no significant change in circumstance to warrant another review. The fact is my circumstance did change. On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXXEST I received a call from Wells Fargo , and after weeks of giving me the runaround, I was told that unfortunately there was nothing that can be done and my home will go up for sale on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. I refused to accept this. On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, I was forced to file bankruptcy to stop the sale date. This was only to buy time, so from XX/XX/XXXX to the present time, I have been again sending complete modification packages for review, but each time, XXXX XXXX would respond back that they will not review due to no significant change. I find it mind blowing that Wells Fargo will sell my home to complete stranger, instead of working with me. There is currently another sale date on my home for XX/XX/XXXX. Here 's the current status : I 've submitted several offers for my home to either write offer the full amount, the late fees, or offer me the asking sale cost. Proof of funds was provided and I can afford my home. Current mortgage amount $ XXXX and now there 's $ XXXX in accrued late fees. WF was selling my home for $ XXXX rather than extending that offer to me. When I started the modification process I was never told that my credit would be destroyed, so although I have a XXXX income, due to my credit score I can not get another home mortgage, rent a location, and do not qualify for low income housing. I have a XXXX year old daughter and Wells Fargo rather have us evicted in lieu of working with me. Is this the system that we have in place? My only option is to pay the late fees ( $ XXXX ) and my mortgage of $ XXXX ( $ XXXX ), but they will sell my home for $ XXXX and have me and my daughter live on the street.

These errors are in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S. Code 1681, specifically sections 1681e ( b ) and 1681i ( a ), among others.

Inaccurate Personal Information ( Wrong Addresses ) : The following addresses are not associated with me and should not appear on my credit file. Their inclusion raises privacy and security concerns and implies potential mixed-file or identity theft issues : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX LA XXXX XXXX Address XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, LA XXXX Wrong Address Violation : Under FCRA 1681e ( b ), Experian is required to maintain maximum possible accuracy in the information they report.

My Experience & Harm : Despite submitting disputes to Experian regarding both the inaccurate addresses and the XXXX charge-off, Experian failed to properly investigate or remove the errors.

XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, SC XXXX handling of my loan and intended modification application submitted since XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
As an honorable veteran who has served his country faithfully, I initially utilized my entitlement to obtain a home loan in XXXX. Since purchasing the above property in XXXX, the home loan has been "" sold '' approximately four ( 4 ) times. In XXXX, XXXX XXXX 's acquired the Ditech brand due to FCC and your charges against Greentree Mortgage Company. Apparently, this acquisition has not eradicate years of Greentree Mortgage legal and unethical practices towards their consumers, because Ditech is the same, if not worse to their consumers. They are unethical, harassing me about my debt, calling all times of day and night, from different numbers, when I have told them not to contact me, being misleading and threatening towards me. 
Since Ditech Financial, LLC has handled the loan, my experience with the company has been totally reprehensible and a violation of my rights. The company has failed to appropriately handle my loan modification request submitted on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, after I filed numerous complaints both, verbal, written and in contacting their corporate office. Instead of resolving the matter, my complaints aggravated the entire matter without any personal recourse or advocacy. In submitting the loan modification application, they would always provide "" XXXX to XXXX '' DIFFERENT FAX NUMBERS TO EITHER SUBMIT OR RE-SUBMIT INFORMATION which has been very misleading. After submitting the information, they would always say "" they did not receive the information. '' My PERSONAL INFORMATION WENT TO SOMEONE ... SOMEWHERE!!! With months of delaying the loan modification, my credit rating has been affected, additional costs have occurred on the loan and this ordeal has taken a mental and physical toll on me and my family. 
I am locked into Ditech being my loan servicer. At this point, I do not feel or believe that I am or will be treated fairly regarding my loan modification or any other matter. I am in financial distress, and I am not seeking to negate my financial responsibilities. However, I am attempting to work towards resolving my delinquent status and to modify the mortgage payments. 
Lastly, I and my wife are very disturb to the fact that Ditech had a third party to deliver a "" door knocker '' to our address on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX with a number of XXXX. When my wife called the number it was a XXXX XXXX!! When my wife brought it to XXXX ' attention and thought it was intentional. They responded as if it was not a problem or concern. The next month on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, the "" door knocker '' had a different number, XXXX.

I received a letter stating that my profit / loss statement was invalid because it was not signed ( I own the business ) .The female I spoke with said I had been approved for a HAMP modification, which I knew nothing about. I told Ocwen I had not received any paperwork. She emailed me the information, which I received on XXXX XXXX. I was also set up with a phone meeting with my Ocwen loan representative, XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX. I did receive a phone call from Ocwen on XXXX XXXX, but not from my loan representative. I stated that I had read the information and would like to move forward with the HAMP modification. I was told it was no longer an option because I had missed 2 of the trial payments, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I politely told the gentleman that I had not even received the information on the modification until XXXX XXXX, and that there was no way I could have made a payment on XXXX XXXX, when I was n't even aware I was approved for the modification.

They said it was a drive by inspection, but when I asked them if the home was under construction or not ( it is ) they could not answer. They have claimed to have sent certified mail to the home, but can not produce a signed mail receipt. The address on the statements is not even the correct mailing address.

This is severely damaging my business, which relies upon access to those funds. Those funds are held in trust, and Square is both in breach of its contract and has committed unjust enrichment, as well as a failure to meet the duty of good faith and fair dealing. 

I am continuing to try and resolve this in good faith and through direct communication. Please have an account representative correct this matter promptly and restore my access. If an account representative is unable to act, please forward this to your legal department, as they should, at a minimum, recognize the wrongful conduct committed by Square and act promptly to avoid legal costs.

If this is a deliberate policy action, it may be that a class action is the only recourse to obtaining justice for both myself and to ensure that others like me dont have to suffer the same issue.

1554544,"This is a second complaint filed -- the initial complaint resulted in the bank rescinding the original foreclosure. We discussed the payment required to enter into a forbearance agreement. The original amount discussed was significantly lower -- the amount that was offered by the bank was eventually much higher and the funds were not available to make such a payment. We agreed to sell the family home after making certain renovations : those renovations ( about 80 % ) were made at a cost of over {$40000.00}. We began listing the house a short while ago. It was our understanding that the bank would give us the time to try and sell the house at a reasonable valuation. The listing price was almost XXXX % below the tax appraised value -- I think it showed we were serious about selling the home as quickly as possible. A great deal of work went into the staging and removal of most personal items to a storage center. 

We were scheduled for a realtor open house last weekend when a stranger knocked at our door saying the property was listed in the paper for foreclosure just a a little over a week away and wanted us to retain him to fight the bank -- we declined. A couple of days later a letter arrived from the Bank 's law firm saying the foreclosure was re-instated and scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. The bank officials with whom we had discussed the forbearance, etc.had out emails and telephone numbers -- they made no attempt to contact us an alert us they were moving in this direction. We in good faith made several investment renovations decisions in the prior week, including purchasing new counter tops and appliances for the kitchen and replacement windows. It appears that this investment has been for nothing and we will lose these money. The auction will only bring an amount close to the banks loan/lien and we will see $ XXXX - $ XXXX of equity disappear. 

Given our willingness to list and sell the house at a discount, I think it would only have been right for the bank to provide this time.

3895489,"On Friday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, I got a text from Wells Fargo asking if I could verify card activity of {$160.00}. I immediately looked at my account information online and saw that I had 4 non-Wells FargXXXX ATM withdrawals. Luckily, the 5th withdrawal was declined. 
I called their XXXX number at XXXX to let them know that I had fraudulentcharges on my card. They asked me what charges weren't mine and I told them, a charge from XXXX WA for {$120.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, a charge from XXXX XXXX WA for {$120.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, a charge from XXXX WA for {$120.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, and one on from XXXX WA for {$120.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. Again, all from non-Wells Fargo ATMs. They asked me if I still had my card with me and I said yes. They asked me if I've given my card out to anyone and I said no. They canceled my card right away and told me to wait for 5 minutes while she talked to claims. Upon return she said it was denied. 
I was shocked at how fast they decided to decline my claim. I'm assuming they denied my case because unfortunately, all the transactions happened in Washington and I currently live in Washington. But I assumed my bank would have done a more thorough investigation because {$490.00} is ALOT of money for me and seeing that we're in a pandemic, I just thought they would be more helpful and caring since that is what they preach on their website about their response to the impact of COVID-19. 
The same day I went to my nearest Wells Fargo bank to talk to someone in person because the person I talked to over the phone really lacked any sort of empathy for my situation. The person that I talk to, I believe his name is XXXX XXXX, sat down with me and we discussed what had happened. He too was surprised that they only reviewed my case for 5 minutes. I asked him if it was possible for people to make fake cards and he said yes, hackers can do that and that skimmers can get that information. He helped me submit an ask for a 2nd review. He told me that I should hear back from someone and if I don't hear from anyone to call back. 
While I was waiting to hear back from Wells Fargo, I did my own research. XXXX printed out a "" Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX '' where I'm able to see the time of each transaction and sometimes the address, bank, or ATM number it was withdrawn from. I called the XXXX in XXXX and XXXX XXXX  to ask if they could give me some pictures around the time that the ATM withdrawals happened. They both said they couldn't give that information out to the public but would happily give it to my bank if they requested it, and they added that they SHOULD request it because that's what banks are supposed to do, or at least that'swhat XXXX and XXXX XXXX  does. Only slightly relieved, I thought that surely my bank would ask them for that information and see that it's someone else withdrawing money. I also noticed that I was at work on one of those dates during the time the withdrawal occurred. I asked my place of work if they could write a letter for proof and they sent it to me which I'll be attaching. 
I called the XXXX number today, Monday XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX and asked where my investigation was at. I was told that it was denied, again. I asked if I was able to submit my work letter because that's solid evidence that the withdrawal couldn't have been me and she said no. She explained that Wells Fargosreasoning is that the transactions say that my card was swiped and that the pin was put in. XXXX told me that it is possible for thatinformation to get out and get duplicated. So I'm hearing from Wells Fargo staff that fake cards can exist, but the staff over the XXXX number are acting like that couldn't possibly be an option, and different major banks are saying that Wells Fargo should also be requesting footage from when/where the transactions took place but I don't think they even attempted to get the footage. I'm stuck left wondering, what exactly did Wells Fargo specifically investigate then?

3378874,"LoanCare has not resolved an Escrow mis-calculation complaint that was submitted by mail on XX/XX/XXXX. The complaint was acknowledged by LoanCare on XX/XX/XXXX and followed up by a letter dated 35 days later on XX/XX/XXXX indicating that they had opened a research inquiry with the tax department and that they would be sending an update within 7 to 10 days. As of today ( XX/XX/XXXX ), we have not received the update that was promised by their letter to be given by the first of XX/XX/XXXX. 

As per the account information online at XXXX as of today XX/XX/XXXX, the escrow analysis still indicates a inflated monthly escrow amount of {$600.00}. This was calculated by the using the incorrect tax impound amounts supported by the documents that were sent to Loancare with the complaint. The notification of the error was originally emailed to Customer service in XX/XX/XXXX and later sent by letter on XX/XX/XXXX that was acknowledged on XX/XX/XXXX. Based on this erroneous escrow analysis, Loancare indicated that there was a {$2100.00} escrow shortage that calculated a new monthly escrow impound of {$600.00} ( up from the original amount of {$280.00}, a whopping {$320.00} increase! ) With the application of the correct tax impound, the shortage today ( since I have now made 2 mortgage payments with the impound amount calculated by using erroneous property tax information ) would be calculated at {$750.00}. Since LoanCare requires a minimum 2 month reserve, this translates to a new monthly escrow impound of {$330.00}. It appears LoanCare may be attempting to drag this resolution out, well past the RESPA 60 day requirement which is a violation of Section 6 of the Real Estate Settlement procedures Act, until I have made the XX/XX/XXXX payment with the erroneous impound amount. This could be an attempt to require me to pay the entire remaining shortage at that point of {$410.00} within 30 days because it would then not be required to be spread over 12 months as it would then be less than 1/6 of the yearly escrow projection. I hope that this is not the case, and has not been the intention of the company from the beginning. I am concerned because of the 100s of complaints that are readily available on line about LoanCare and their questionable loan servicing practices.

15036992,"Issue Type : Credit Reporting / Mortgage Servicing Company : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : Mortgage Loan Problem Description : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has refused to correct multiple late payment entries on my credit report that are factually inaccurate, unsupported by servicing records, and appear to be part of a systematic scheme to trigger foreclosure default. These entries stem from misapplication of payments, delayed crediting, and servicing errors that violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ). 

Despite timely payments made within grace periods or within the same billing cycle, the bank reported the following months as delinquent : XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Their own records show payments were received within reasonable timeframes ( e.g., XX/XX/XXXX for XXXX payment ), yet they still marked the account as 3090 days past due. This pattern suggests intentional misreporting designed to manufacture default status, enabling foreclosure proceedings and damaging my credit profile. 

I have submitted prior disputes and received a response that they can not make corrections, despite clear contradictions in their own documentation. This refusal to investigate and correct errors violates : 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) Reporting information known to be inaccurate 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ) Failure to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 Servicing errors under RESPA This misconduct has caused irreparable harm, including emotional distress, loss of housing opportunities, and reputational damage.

1338862,"I have lived in the XXXX County area most of my life, and I want to continue to live here and do so in my home. I have seen many good times, and recently I 've seen rough times. Unfortunately, I may be forced out of my home by my mortgage note holder, Select Portfolio Servicing ( SPS ), since they have been uncooperative and even deceptive when I try to work out a solution with them. 

My hardship began in XXXX when unfortunately my father passed away and 8 months later my daughter ran away from home. This emotional turmoil tore my family apart, and then my XXXX collapsed in XXXX. In XXXX, my husband and I got divorced ; and to top it off, I even lost my beloved dog in XXXX as well. The combination of all these events is what caused me to fall behind on my mortgage. 

When this run of unfortunate events began in XXXX, I reached out for help and was offered a rather unfair trial modification. I decided to go forward with in order to keep my home, but I was denied for a permanent modification once I completed the trial period due to missing documents that I had submitted many times to them. They kept making me start over with the process using the same reasoning for denial ( missing documents ), always taking my payments for three months before telling me they could n't move forward and that I had to start over. This continued for 3 years (!!! ) until they told me my arrears were now too high and I did n't qualify for assistance. It appears to me that this was their plan all along ... they had no interest in helping me, they just wanted to take my home away via foreclosure. I have being denied access to options that are supposed to be made available. They deceived me, lied to me, and frankly, stole from me while I was acting in good faith!!!!!!! 

Furthermore, I have serious issues with my property value. My property 's present value is below {$600000.00}, which is disturbing when you consider the purchase price we paid was {$1000000.00} with a {$90000.00} down payment. Plus, I 'm in what could be considered a predatory loan. I was somewhat forced into a 3-Year ARM with a high interest rate when I was looking for a 30-Year Fixed Rate loan. 

If I could get SPS to handle this fairly, I 'm sure I would be able to keep my home and make good on my mortgage. I do n't want or need a handout, but considering my financial recovery I am certain that there is a solution that I could qualify for. Is n't that what all this bailout money ( my tax money!! ) passed down from the government to these banks was for? Are n't these modification programs designed for people who had a hardship ( or in my case many hardships ) and have recovered and just need a little assistance restructuring their mortgage in order to move forward? 

I want Select Portfolio Servicing to stop the foreclosure process, review my loan in earnest for retention options, and stop playing games that prevent this problem from being solved.",Mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",1

Unverifiable - you may want proof that a creditor or debt collector has the right to collect from you, and you find out that they dont have your original hand- signed contract on file anymore - paperwork gets lost. No proof of contract means no authority to report or collect from you. 

I also sent Experian Credit Bureau information about the company in question. Experian has not been forth coming either, saying that they have spoken with and validated the information to be true. Yet, I still have not received any evidence to prove that fact. I have asked time and time again as you will see in my attached letters to Experian and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to do what is right.

Reference : XXXX Account Number : XXXX Dear CFPB, I am writing to dispute the response provided by Bounce AI, Inc. dated XX/XX/XXXX, regarding the alleged debt referenced above. Bounce AI , Inc. claims to have "" purchased all rights, title, and interest to this debt from XXXX XXXX XXXX '' on XX/XX/XXXX. However, their response fails to provide any verifiable evidence of this purchase, as required under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). Without such proof, Bounce AI , Inc. has no legal authority to collect this debt or report it to my credit file, and I demand that they either provide conclusive documentation or immediately delete this item from all credit reports. 

In my initial complaint, I requested validation of the debt, specifically proof of Bounce AI , Inc. 's legal right to collect on this account. While Bounce AI , Inc. provided a copy of a Line of Credit Agreement, they have failed to substantiate their claim of ownership with a chain of title, purchase agreement, or any other legally binding document proving the transfer of the debt from XXXX XXXX XXXX to Bounce AI , Inc . Under FDCPA 1692g ( b ), debt collectors must provide proper verification of the debt, including documentation establishing their legal authority to collect. A mere statement claiming purchase is wholly insufficient and does not meet the legal standard for validation.

I demand that Bounce AI, Inc. provide the following to the CFPB : A complete chain of title or a legally binding purchase agreement unequivocally proving that Bounce AI , Inc. acquired the debt from XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, as claimed. 

A detailed accounting of the debt, including a clear breakdown of how the current balance of {$18000.00} was calculated, specifying principal, interest, and fees. 

If Bounce AI , Inc. can not provide this documentation, they must immediately cease all collection activities and delete this account from my credit file, as required by FDCPA 1692g ( b ) and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ). The FCRA obligates debt collectors to ensure the accuracy of reported information, and without proof of ownership, any reporting of this debt is inaccurate and must be removed. Failure to provide this evidence or delete the item violates my consumer rights and constitutes a breach of federal law.

I urge the CFPB to compel Bounce AI , Inc. to either produce the requested proof of debt ownership or permanently delete this account from all credit bureaus. Thank you for your assistance in enforcing my rights under federal law. I look forward to your intervention to ensure Bounce AI , Inc. complies with these requirements.",Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,1
